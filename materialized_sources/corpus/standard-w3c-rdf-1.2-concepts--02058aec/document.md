## Abstract

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for
    representing information on the Web.
    This document defines an abstract data model
    which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications.
    The abstract data model has two key data structures:

RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples,
      where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, datatyped literals, or triple terms.
      They are used to express descriptions of resources.

RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs,
      and consist of a default graph and zero or more named graphs.

Compared to RDF 1.1, RDF 1.2 introduces the ability to use an RDF triple as a triple term , in the object position of another triple .
    RDF 1.2 also introduces directional language-tagged strings ,
    which contain a base direction component that allows the
    initial text direction to be specified for presentation by a user agent.
    Finally, to ease the transition from RDF 1.1 to RDF 1.2,
    this specification introduces a mechanism for explicitly conveying the version of RDF that is used by a given piece of data.

This specification introduces key concepts and terminology for RDF 1.2, and subsequently discusses
    datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within
    RDF graphs.


## Status of This Document

This section describes the status of this
      document at the time of its publication. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found
      in the W3C standards and drafts index .

This document is part of the RDF 1.2 document suite.
    It is the central RDF 1.2 specification and defines the core RDF concepts.
    Test suites and implementation reports of a number of RDF 1.2
    specifications that build on this document are available from 
    the rdf-tests repository
    under rdf-tests/rdf/rdf12 as referenced in each of the specifications.

RDF 1.2 Concepts (this specification) describes an abstract data model,
    and does not have an independant test suite, as it is not directly implemented in software.
    Instead, it is implemented by the specifications which build on top of it .
    As a consequence, to exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase,
    the W3C RDF & SPARQL Working Group requires that [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ] and at least one specification for a concrete syntax (e.g. [ RDF12-N-TRIPLES ])
    have met their own exit criteria for the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase.

RDF 1.2 Concepts is an update to [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ],
    which was itself, an update to [ RDF-CONCEPTS-20040210 ].

This document was published by the RDF & SPARQL Working Group as
    a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot using the Recommendation track .

Publication as a Candidate Recommendation does not
  imply endorsement by W3C and its Members. A Candidate Recommendation Snapshot has received wide review , is intended to
        gather implementation experience ,
        and has commitments from Working Group members to royalty-free licensing for implementations.

This Candidate Recommendation is not expected to advance to
          Recommendation any earlier than 05 May 2026.

This document was produced by a group
        operating under the W3C Patent
          Policy . W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of
          the group; that page also includes
          instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual
          knowledge of a patent that the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy .

## 1. Introduction

This section is non-normative.

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework
  for representing information on the Web.

This document defines an abstract data model
  which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications,
  including the following:

the formal model-theoretic semantics for RDF [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ]

serialization syntaxes for storing and exchanging RDF such as RDF 1.2 N-Triples [ RDF12-N-TRIPLES ], RDF 1.2 Turtle [ RDF12-TURTLE ],
      and JSON-LD 1.1 [ JSON-LD11 ]

the SPARQL 1.2 Query Language [ SPARQL12-QUERY ]

the RDF 1.2 Schema [ RDF12-SCHEMA ]


### 1.1 Graph-based Abstract Data Model

The core structure of the abstract data model is a set of triples , each consisting of a subject ,
      a predicate and an object . A set of such triples is called
      an RDF graph . An RDF graph can be visualized as a node and
      directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a
      node-arc-node link.

There are four kinds of nodes that can be in an RDF graph : IRIs , literals , blank nodes , and triple terms .

From this definition, it follows that when one term appears in multiple
      triples, these are simply multiple occurrences of that same term. For
      example, in a graph containing two triples (here expressed in common set and tuple notation, and
      using abstract names as distinct terms):

{ (R1, P1, R3),
  (R2, P2, R3) }

the term R3 is the same single term used twice, and there are five terms
      in total. This is more readily shown in two-dimensional graph diagrams,
      where one single node can simply be connected from or to multiple other
      nodes using labelled arcs.

This abstract data model can be encoded in different ways while
      preserving the same stucture, as described in 1.9 RDF Documents and Syntaxes .


### 1.2 Resources and Statements

Any IRI or literal denotes something in the world (the "universe of discourse").
    These things are called resources . Anything can be a resource,
    including physical things, documents, abstract concepts, numbers
    and strings; the term is synonymous with "entity" as it is used in RDF 1.2 Semantics [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ].
    The resource denoted by an IRI is called its referent , and the
    resource denoted by a literal is called its literal value . Literals have datatypes that define the range of possible
    values, such as strings, numbers, and dates. Special kinds of literals — language-tagged strings and directional language-tagged strings —
    respectively denote plain-text strings in a natural language and plain-text
    strings in a natural language including an initial text direction.

Asserting an RDF triple says that some relationship,
    indicated by the predicate , holds between the resources denoted by
    the subject and object (as explained below , not all triples are asserted).
    This statement corresponding
    to an RDF triple is known as an RDF statement .
    The predicate itself is an IRI and denotes a property ,
    that is, a resource that can be thought of as a binary relation.
    (Relations that involve more than two entities can only be indirectly
    expressed in RDF [ SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS ].)

Unlike IRIs and literals , blank nodes do not identify specific resources . Statements involving blank nodes say that something with the given relationships
      exists, without explicitly naming it.


### 1.3 The Referent of an IRI

The resource denoted by an IRI is also called its referent . For some IRIs with particular
      meanings, such as those identifying XSD datatypes, the referent is
      fixed by this specification. For all other IRIs, what exactly is denoted by any given IRI is not defined by this specification. Other
      specifications may fix IRI referents, or apply other constraints on
      what may be the referent of any IRI .

Guidelines for determining the referent of an IRI are
      provided in other documents, like Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One [ WEBARCH ]
      and Cool URIs for the Semantic Web [ COOLURIS ].
      A very brief, informal, and partial account follows:

By design, IRIs have global scope. Thus, two different appearances of an IRI denote the same resource . Violating this principle constitutes
        an IRI collision [ WEBARCH ].

By social convention, the IRI owner [ WEBARCH ] gets to say what the intended (or usual)
        referent of an IRI is. Applications and users need not
        abide by this intended denotation, but there may be a loss of
        interoperability with other applications and users if they do
        not do so.

The IRI owner can establish the intended referent by means of a specification or other document that explains
        what is denoted. For example, the The Organization Ontology [ VOCAB-ORG ]
        specifies the intended referents of various IRIs that start with http://www.w3.org/ns/org# .

A good way of communicating the intended referent
        is to set up the IRI so that it dereferences [ WEBARCH ]
        to such a document.

Such a document can, in fact, be an RDF document that describes the denoted resource by means of RDF statements .

Perhaps the most important characteristic of IRIs in web architecture is that they can be dereferenced ,
      and hence serve as starting points for interactions with a remote server.
      This specification is not concerned with such interactions.
      It does not define an interaction model. It only treats IRIs as globally
      unique identifiers in a graph data model that describes resources.
      However, those interactions are critical to the concept of Linked Data Design Issues , [ LINKED-DATA ],
      which uses the RDF abstract syntax and concrete RDF syntaxes ,
	  the latter also referred to as serialization formats.


### 1.4 RDF Vocabularies and Namespace IRIs

An RDF vocabulary is a collection of IRIs intended for use in RDF graphs . For example,
      the IRIs documented in [ RDF12-SCHEMA ] are the RDF Schema vocabulary.
      RDF Schema can itself be used to define and document additional
      RDF vocabularies. Some such vocabularies are mentioned in the RDF 1.2 Primer [ RDF12-PRIMER ].

The IRIs in an RDF vocabulary often begin with
      a common substring known as a namespace IRI .
      Some namespace IRIs are associated by convention with a short name
      known as a namespace prefix .

In some serialization formats, it is common
      to associate some namespace IRIs with arbitrary namespace prefixes ,
      and to improve readability by abbreviating IRIs that start with one of those namespace IRIs by using the corresponding namespace prefix .
      For example,
      based on the prefix mapping in the table above ,
      the IRI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral would be abbreviated as rdf:XMLLiteral .
      Note however that such abbreviations are not meant to be processed directly as IRIs,
      and are not to be used in syntactic contexts where IRIs are expected.
      Note also that namespace IRIs and namespace prefixes are not a formal part of the RDF abstract data model.
      They are merely a syntactic convenience for abbreviating IRIs;
      for processing, the actual IRIs are reconstructed by replacing each namespace prefix with the corresponding namespace IRI .

The term “ namespace ” on its own does not have a
      well-defined meaning in the context of RDF, but is sometimes informally
      used to mean “ namespace IRI ” or “ RDF vocabulary ”.


### 1.5 Triple Terms and Reification

A triple term is an RDF triple used as an RDF term within another triple. 
      Being an RDF triple , it denotes a proposition .

A reifying triple is a triple where the predicate is rdf:reifies and the object is a triple term .
      The subject of that triple is called a reifier , and it can be the
      subject or object of other triples.

A reifier may denote a variety of things that are related to the triple term's proposition , 
      such as a statement or belief that the proposition holds.
      It is expected that the reifiers (rather than the triple terms ) will be used in further statements.
      This section briefly describes this common usage.
      For more examples, refer to the RDF 1.2 Primer [ RDF12-PRIMER ].

For example, the following diagram represents a reifying triple of a triple term , together with a triple that includes the reifier as the subject .
    The latter describes the reifier as a claim, made by :Bob , that the proposition denoted by the reified triple term holds. In other words, :Bob claims that :Alice 's family name is "Liddell".

In this example, the proposition denoted by the triple term (i.e., the proposition that :Alice 's family name is "Liddell" ) is not claimed to be true.
      That would only be the case if the triple used as a triple term was also an asserted triple in the RDF graph.

 By using non-asserted triple terms, as in the figure, one can make statements about unasserted statements; 
 for example, if one is unsure whether :Alice 's family name is actually "Liddell" .

Here is a variation on the graph shown in Figure 3 . This represents a graph
      where an asserted triple corresponds to the triple term object of a reifying triple . 
    In this case, 
      the subset of triples including the reifier as subject—as illustrated in these examples—
      is called a triple annotation .

Concrete syntaxes, such as Turtle [ RDF12-TURTLE ], may have shortcuts
      for specifying reifying triples and triple annotations more
      succinctly.

Finally, RDF terms that appear in a triple term have the same denotation as when they appear in an asserted triple in the graph .
For example, the term :Alice from a triple term and :Alice in an asserted triple both denote the same resource.
      For this reason, we say that triple terms are transparent .

As already stated, reifiers are meant to serve a broad range of use cases:
        statements or beliefs that a proposition is true,
        situations in which the proposition is true,
        events that caused the proposition to become true,
        etc.
        Because of this diversity,
        the meaning of the rdf:reifies property is deliberately generic.

There can be multiple, distinct reifiers related to the same abstract
        proposition, such as statements with different sources, or
        situations with different characteristics. One reifier may also be
        used to reify multiple, distinct propositions, 
        expressing for example the fact that the same situation could stem from different propositions.

Since a proposition that is reified does not have to hold, it is possible
        to make statements about any kind of statement, including an unasserted
        statement that contradicts another statement, whether asserted or not.


### 1.6 RDF and Change over Time

The RDF abstract data model is atemporal : RDF graphs are static snapshots of information.

However, RDF graphs can express information
      about events and about temporal aspects of other entities,
      given appropriate vocabulary terms.

Since RDF graphs are defined as mathematical
      sets, adding or removing triples from an
      RDF graph yields a different RDF graph.

We informally use the term RDF source to refer to a
      persistent yet mutable source or container of RDF graphs . An RDF source is a resource that may be said to have a state that can change over time.
      A snapshot of the state can be expressed as an RDF graph.
      For example, any web document that has an RDF-bearing representation
      may be considered an RDF source. Like all resources, RDF sources may
      be named with IRIs and therefore described in
      other RDF graphs.

Intuitively speaking, changes in the universe of discourse
      can be reflected in the following ways:

An IRI , once minted, should never
        change its intended referent . (See URI persistence [ WEBARCH ].)

Literals , by design, are constants and
        never change their value .

A relationship that holds between two resources at one time may not hold at another time.

RDF sources may change their state over time.
        That is, they may provide different RDF graphs at different times.

Some RDF sources may, however, be immutable
        snapshots of another RDF source, archiving its state at some
        point in time.


### 1.7 Working with Multiple RDF Graphs

As RDF graphs are sets of triples, they can be
      combined easily, supporting the use of data from
      multiple sources. Nevertheless, it is sometimes desirable to work
      with multiple RDF graphs while keeping their contents separate. RDF datasets support this requirement.

An RDF dataset is a collection of RDF graphs . All but one of these graphs have
      an associated IRI or blank node. They are called named graphs , and the IRI or blank node
      is called the graph name .
      The remaining graph does not have an associated IRI , and is called
      the default graph of the RDF dataset.

There are many possible uses for RDF datasets .
      One such use is to hold snapshots of multiple RDF sources .


### 1.8 Equivalence, Entailment and Inconsistency

An RDF triple denotes a proposition — a
      simple logical expression, describing a relationship between two entities.
      An asserted triple is a claim that the corresponding proposition is true.
      An RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND ) of
      all the claims made by its asserted triples .
      The precise details of this meaning of RDF triples and RDF graphs are
      the subject of RDF 1.2 Semantics [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ], which yields the
      following relationships between RDF graphs :

An entailment regime [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ] is a specification that
      defines precise conditions that make these relationships hold.
      RDF itself recognizes only some basic cases of entailment, equivalence and inconsistency. Other specifications, such as RDF 1.2 Schema [ RDF12-SCHEMA ]
      and OWL 2 [ OWL2-OVERVIEW ], add more powerful entailment regimes,
      as do some domain-specific vocabularies .

This specification does not constrain how implementations
      use the logical relationships defined by entailment regimes .
      Implementations may or may not detect inconsistencies , and may make all,
      some or no entailed information
      available to users.


### 1.9 RDF Documents and Syntaxes

An RDF document is a document that encodes an RDF graph or RDF dataset in a concrete RDF syntax ,
      such as N-Triples [ RDF12-N-TRIPLES ], Turtle [ RDF12-TURTLE ], RDFa [ RDFA-CORE ], JSON-LD [ JSON-LD11 ], or
      TriG [ RDF12-TRIG ]. RDF documents enable the exchange of RDF graphs and RDF
      datasets between systems.

A concrete RDF syntax may offer
      many different ways to encode the same RDF graph or RDF dataset , for example through the use of namespace prefixes , IRI references , blank node identifiers ,
      and different ordering of triples. While these aspects can have great
      effect on the convenience of working with the RDF document ,
      they are not significant for its meaning.

The basis for concrete RDF syntaxes is the structure of the abstract data model ,
      called the abstract syntax ;
      summarized in the following two tables.


### 1.10 RDF Version Announcement

To allow RDF parsers to error or warn about unsupported RDF versions as early as possible,
      RDF serialization formats are expected to allow a version to be specified,
      via either a media-type parameter,
      a version announcement in a format-specific syntax,
      or both.

When the version is indicated both in a media-type parameter and in syntax,
      they are expected to be the same.
      If they differ,
      parsers use the version from the media-type parameter and might emit a warning about the mismatch.

To retain compability that is as broad as possible with older parsers,
      only RDF documents that make use of RDF 1.2-specific functionality
      are encouraged to announce their version (i.e., for RDF documents that do not make use
      of RDF 1.2-specific functionality it is discouraged to announce a version).

To announce the version in the HTTP responses using the Content-Type header,
      the server is expected to use the version parameter,
      as illustrated in the following example response.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type : text/turtle; version=1.2 Location : http://example.com/document.ttl

Servers are also expected to announce the version in-line,
      when the format supports in-line version announcement
      (such as RDF 1.2 Turtle [ RDF12-TURTLE ]).

When requesting an RDF document from an HTTP server, a client 
      can use the version parameter 
      during content negotiation [ WEBARCH ],
      by including it in the Accept request header,
      as illustrated in the following example request.

GET /document.ttl HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com Accept : text/turtle; version=1.2

Section 2.1 Version Labels defines version labels to be used with the version parameter and in concrete RDF syntax .

As HTTP content negotiation is advisory,
      clients receiving a document should be prepared to properly handle a document
      of the requested media type but potentially having a version other than what was
      requested.
      Clients may consider down-grading the content to an appropriate version themselves
      as discussed in 2.1.1 Server Considerations .


## 2. Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY , MUST , MUST NOT , RECOMMENDED , SHOULD , and SHOULD NOT in this document
        are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [ RFC2119 ] [ RFC8174 ]
        when, and only when, they appear in all
        capitals, as shown here.

This specification, RDF 1.2 Concepts and Abstract Data Model ,
    defines an abstract data model and related vocabulary for use in
    other specifications, such as concrete RDF syntaxes ,
    API specifications, and query languages.
    Implementations cannot directly conform to RDF 1.2 Concepts and Abstract Data Model ,
    but can conform to such other specifications that normatively
    reference terms defined here.

This specification establishes two conformance levels:

Full conformance supports graphs and datasets with triples that contain triple terms .

Basic conformance only supports graphs and/or datasets with triples that only contain basic RDF terms — i.e.,
      they do not contain triple terms .


### 2.1 Version Labels

A version label is a string that identifies the syntax and semantics conformance
      for the RDF data.

Data conforming to version "1.1" is valid as data with version "1.2-basic", 
      and data conforming to version "1.2-basic" is valid as data with version "1.2".
      Data conforming to version "1.1" has the same semantics 
      under RDF 1.1 Semantics and under RDF 1.2 Semantics .

See RDF 1.2 Interoperability for details of encoding "1.2" as "1.2-basic".

For serializations supporting in-line version announcement,
      the version announcement SHOULD be made early in the document
      and certainly before serializing any feature depending on that version.


#### 2.1.1 Server Considerations

This section is non-normative.

When serializing a graph or dataset which uses features incompatible
        with a requested version, servers can consider different alternatives:

Eliminate triple terms by using an algorithm such
          as basic encoding as defined in RDF 1.2 Interoperability (downgrading from version "1.2" to "1.2-basic").

Replace directional language-tagged strings by literals with a datatype IRI that
          uses the i18n namespace , as defined in [ JSON-LD11 ]
          (downgrading from version "1.2" or "1.2-basic" to "1.1").

Return 406 "Not Acceptable" .

Ignore the requested version and return a native representation.

The suggestion here is to follow the Robustness principle (also known as Postel's Law):
        servers should be conservative in what they send, be liberal in what they accept.


#### 2.1.2 Client Considerations

This section is non-normative.

If a document has no stated version (either by HTTP header or internal),
        systems can assume the version is "1.2" , which continues to
        support all prior RDF versions.

When parsing a document with conflicting versions,
        or when parsing a document using unsupported versions, a parser
        may do any of the following:

Ignore the version directive.

Raise an error and abort.

Issue a warning and ignore the triple.

Parse the structure and only emit triples consistent with the declared version.


### 2.2 Strings in RDF

RDF uses Unicode [ Unicode ] as the fundamental representation for string values.
      Within this and related specifications, the term RDF string ,
      or simply string ,
      is used to describe an ordered sequence of zero or more Unicode code points which are Unicode scalar values .
      Unicode scalar values do not include the surrogate code points .
      Note that most concrete RDF syntaxes require the use
      of the UTF-8 character encoding [ RFC3629 ], 
      and use the \u0000 or \U00000000 forms to express certain non-character values.

A string is identical to another string if it consists of the same sequence of code points.
      An implementation MAY determine string equality by comparing the code units of two strings
      that use the same Unicode character encoding (UTF-8 or UTF-16) without decoding the string into a Unicode code point sequence.


## 3. RDF Graphs

An RDF graph is a set of RDF triples .

An RDF triple that is an element of an RDF graph is also said to be asserted in that RDF graph .


### 3.1 Triples

An RDF triple (often simply called "triple")
     is a 3-tuple that is defined inductively as follows:

If s is an IRI or a blank node , p is an IRI , and o is an IRI , a blank node , or a literal ,
        then ( s , p , o ) is an RDF triple .

If s is an IRI or a blank node , p is an IRI , and o is an RDF triple ,
        then ( s , p , o ) is an RDF triple .

The three components ( s , p , o ) of an RDF triple are respectively called the subject , predicate and object of the triple.

The definition of triple is recursive.
      That is, a triple can itself have an object component which is another triple .
      However, by this definition, cycles of triples cannot be created.

The set of nodes of an RDF graph is the set of subjects and objects of the asserted triples of the graph.
      It is possible for a predicate IRI to also occur as a node in
      the same graph.

Triple equality :
      Two triples ( s , p , o ) and ( s' , p' , o' )
      are equal (the same RDF triple ) if and only if all of the following three conditions hold.

s and s' are equal .

p and p' are equal .

o and o' are equal .


### 3.2 RDF Terms

IRIs , literals , blank nodes , and triple terms are collectively known as RDF terms .

IRIs , literals and blank nodes are said to be basic RDF terms .

RDF term equality :
      Two RDF terms t and t' are equal (the same RDF term ) if and only if
      one of the following four conditions holds:

t and t' are IRIs that are equal (per IRI equality ).

t and t' are literals that are equal (per literal term equality ).

t and t' are blank nodes that are equal (per blank node equality ).

t and t' are triple terms that are equal (per triple equality ).

The set of RDF terms appearing in an RDF triple t is defined inductively as follows:

The subject , predicate and object of t appear in t .

If the object of t is an RDF triple t2 , then any RDF term appearing in t2 also appears in t .

By extension, an RDF term is said to appear in an RDF graph if it appears in an asserted triple of that graph. 
      An RDF triple is said to appear in an RDF graph if it is either an asserted triple of that graph or a triple term appearing in that graph.

An RDF term is said to be ground if any of the following three conditions holds:

It is an IRI .

It is a literal .

It is a triple term ( s , p , o ) such that s , p , and o are all ground .

By extension, an RDF triple is said to be ground if its subject , predicate , and object are all ground.
      An RDF graph is said to be ground if all its asserted triples are ground .


### 3.3 IRIs

An IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) within an RDF graph
      is a string that conforms to the syntax
      defined in RFC 3987 [ RFC3987 ].

An IRI in the RDF abstract syntax MUST be resolved per [ RFC3986 ] and MUST NOT be a relative reference .
      An IRI MAY contain a fragment identifier .
      An IRI SHOULD follow rules defined by the IRI scheme .

IRI equality :
      Two IRIs are equal if and only if they consist of the same sequence of Unicode code points ,
      as in Simple String Comparison in section 5.3.1 of [ RFC3987 ].
      (This is done in the abstract syntax, so the IRIs are resolved
      IRIs with no escaping or encoding.)
      Further normalization MUST NOT be performed before this comparison.

For convenience, a complete [ ABNF ] grammar
      from [ RFC3987 ] is provided in F. IRI Grammar .

URIs and IRIs: IRIs are a generalization of URI s [ RFC3986 ] that permits a wider range of Unicode characters [ UNICODE ].
        Every URI and URL is an IRI , but not every IRI is an URI .
        In RDF, IRIs are used as IRI references , as defined in [ RFC3987 ] section 1.3 .
        An IRI reference is common usage of an Internationalized Resource Identifier.
        An IRI reference refers to either a resolved IRI or relative IRI reference ,
        as described by the IRI -reference production in F. IRI Grammar .
        The abstract syntax uses only fully resolved IRIs .
        When IRIs are used in operations that are only
        defined for URIs, they must first be converted according to
        the mapping defined in section 3.1 of [ RFC3987 ]. A notable example is retrieval over the HTTP
        protocol. The mapping involves UTF-8 encoding of non-ASCII
        characters, %-encoding of octets not allowed in URIs, and
        Punycode-encoding of domain names.

URLs: The URL Standard is largely compatible with [ RFC3987 ] IRIs,
        but is based on a processing model important for implementation
        within web browsers and are not described using an [ ABNF ] grammar.


#### 3.3.1 RDF Reference IRIs

This section is non-normative.

This section provides advice to data publishers.

IRIs are used to denote resources , and each IRI should identify the same
        resource regardless of where that IRI is used.
        Note that the general syntax for IRIs, defined by [ RFC3987 ], can express
        IRIs which do not meet the requirement of being a global reference.
        Some URI schemes add additional requirements; for example, the HTTP URI scheme defines http-URI , which
        requires the presence of a non-empty host name, and, as a consequence, 
        the path component will start with / . 
        The [ RFC3987 ] syntax permits IRIs such as http:abcd and http:///abcd ,
        but these are invalid because they do not satisfy the HTTP URI scheme definition.

An RDF Reference IRI ,
        sometimes called simply RDF Reference ,
        is an IRI that is suitable for use as a global reference.

Reference Resolution: An RDF Reference IRI is unchanged by reference resolution . 
        In URI schemes such as http and https , the path component is part of the hierarchy visible to the 
        resolution algorithm. When resolved, the path component starts with a / character and does not contain . or .. segments.
        For example, https://example/data resolved against any base IRI is https://example/data (unchanged), whereas https://example/path/../data resolved against an arbitrary base IRI is https://example.com/data .

Relative IRI references: Some concrete RDF syntaxes permit relative IRI references (see the irelative-ref production in the IRI Grammar )
        as a convenient shorthand that allows RDF documents to be authored without knowing
        their final publishing location. Relative IRI references must be resolved against a base IRI .
        Therefore, the RDF graph serialized in such syntaxes is well-defined only
        if a base IRI can be established [ RFC3986 ].

URI Schemes: Implementations are encouraged to follow the scheme-specific rules of
        the common schemes, such as the scheme rules for HTTP/HTTPS and the DID syntax .
        Implementations ignore URI scheme rules
        for schemes they do not recognize.

IRI normalization: Interoperability problems can be avoided by minting
        only IRIs that are normalized according to Section 5 of [ RFC3987 ].

Use lowercase characters in scheme names.

Only use percent-encoding of characters where required by the IRI syntax.

Omit the HTTP or HTTPS default port; http://example/ is preferred over http://example:80/ .

Use uppercase hexadecimal letters within percent-encoding
          triplets;" %3F " is preferred over
          " %3f ".

An empty path in an HTTP IRI http://example/ is preferred over
          having no path http://example .

Normalize IRIs to remove " /./ " and " /../ " in the path
          component of an IRI .

Use lowercase characters in domain names. 
          Note that, while ASCII characters in domain names are case-insensitive, 
          non-ASCII characters in domain names are case-sensitive [ RFC5890 ].
          Domains are generally only registered with lowercase letters [ RFC5892 ].

Avoid using the A-label (ASCII, punycode-encoded name]) for Internationalized Domain Names [ RFC5890 ] in IRIs.

Use IRIs in Unicode Normalization Form C [ I18N-Glossary ].


### 3.4 Literals

Literals are used for values such as strings, numbers, and dates.

A literal consists of
      two, three, or four components, as below:

A lexical form , being an RDF string .

A datatype IRI , being an IRI identifying a datatype that determines how the lexical form maps
        to a literal value .

If and only if the datatype IRI is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString or http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString , there is a
        non-empty language tag as defined by [ BCP47 ].
        The language tag MUST be well-formed according to section 2.2.9 of [ BCP47 ],
        and MUST be treated accordingly, that is, in a case-insensitive manner.
        Two [ BCP47 ]-complying strings that differ only by case represent the same language tag .

If and only if the datatype IRI is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString , there is a base direction that MUST be one of the following: ltr , indicating that the initial text direction is set to left-to-right rtl , indicating that the initial text direction is set to right-to-left

ltr , indicating that the initial text direction is set to left-to-right

rtl , indicating that the initial text direction is set to right-to-left

A literal is a language-tagged string if the language tag is present and the base direction is not present.
      A literal is a directional language-tagged string if both the language tag and the base direction are present.

Literal term equality :
      two literals are term-equal (the same RDF term )
      if and only if the following are all true:

The two lexical forms compare equal,
        where this comparison is performed using case-sensitive matching (see description of string comparison in 2.2 Strings in RDF ).

The two datatype IRIs compare equal (per IRI equality ).

The two language tags are either both absent, or both present and compare equal,
        where this comparison is performed using ASCII case-insensitive matching (in contrast to the case-sensitive comparison of the lexical forms).

The two base directions are either both absent, both ltr , or both rtl .


#### 3.4.1 Representation of Literals

Some concrete syntaxes support simple literals consisting of only a lexical form without any datatype IRI , language tag , or base direction .
        Simple literals are syntactic sugar for abstract syntax literals with the datatype IRI http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string (which is commonly abbreviated as xsd:string ).

Similarly, most concrete syntaxes represent language-tagged strings and directional language-tagged strings without
        the datatype IRI because it is always either http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString ( rdf:langString )
        or http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString ( rdf:dirLangString ), respectively.

Any string complying with [ BCP47 ] MAY be used to represent a language tag in concrete syntaxes or implementations.
        Such strings MAY be case normalized
        (for example, by canonicalizing as defined by BCP 47 section 4.5 ).
        Alternatively, an implementation MAY preserve the case from the original representation,
        provided that it processes it in a case-insensitive manner.


#### 3.4.2 Literal Value

The literal value associated with a literal is defined as follows.

If the literal is a language-tagged string ,
          then the literal value is a pair consisting of its lexical form and its language tag , in that order.

If the literal is a directional language-tagged string , then the literal value is
          a tuple of its lexical form , its language tag , and its base direction ,
          likewise in that order.

If the literal's datatype is handled by an RDF implementation, then one of the following applies: If the literal's lexical form is in the lexical space of the datatype , then the literal value is the result of applying
              the lexical-to-value mapping of the datatype to the lexical form . Otherwise, the literal is ill-typed and no literal value can be
               associated with the literal. Such a case produces a semantic inconsistency , but it is not syntactically ill-formed.
               Implementations SHOULD accept ill-typed literals and produce RDF
               graphs from them. Implementations MAY produce warnings when
               encountering ill-typed literals.

If the literal's lexical form is in the lexical space of the datatype , then the literal value is the result of applying
              the lexical-to-value mapping of the datatype to the lexical form .

Otherwise, the literal is ill-typed and no literal value can be
               associated with the literal. Such a case produces a semantic inconsistency , but it is not syntactically ill-formed.
               Implementations SHOULD accept ill-typed literals and produce RDF
               graphs from them. Implementations MAY produce warnings when
               encountering ill-typed literals.

If the literal's datatype IRI is not handled by an RDF implementation, then the literal value is
          not defined by this specification. Implementations SHOULD accept
          literals with unknown datatype IRIs and produce RDF graphs from them.

It follows from the above that two literals can have the same value
        without being the same RDF term .
        For example:

"1" ^^ xsd :integer "01" ^^ xsd :integer

denote the same value , but are not the
        same literal RDF term because their lexical forms differ.


#### 3.4.3 Initial Text Direction

This section is non-normative.

The base direction of a directional language-tagged string provides a means of establishing the initial direction of text,
        including text which is a mixture of right-to-left and left-to-right scripts.
        The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [ I18N-Glossary ] provides support for automatically rendering
        a sequence of characters in logical order,
        so that they are visually ordered as expected,
        but this is not always sufficient to correctly render bidirectional text.

Consider the Arabic translation of the book title "HTML and CSS: Designing Websites".
        In a left-to-right context (such as an English web page),
        with proper bidi isolation but without an explicit base direction,
        it would be incorrectly displayed as follows:

HTML و CSS: تصميم مواقع الويب

while the correct rendering is as follows:

HTML و CSS: تصميم مواقع الويب

That example demonstrates the importance of using directional language-tagged strings instead of simple language-tagged strings in contexts where bidirectional text can be encountered.

Note that the language and base direction address string external bidirectional issues,
        related to correctly displaying the string in context
        (e.g., avoiding spillover problems). It does not address directional issues internal to the string,
        which may occur in more complex examples, such as the following:

" HTML و CSS: تصميم مواقع الويب " is the Arabic title of the book.

A directional language-tagged string representing that example will have the language tag en and the base direction ltr ,
        but also requires specific Unicode bidirectional formatting characters to isolate and mark the text between the quotes as rtl .

For more details, see:

Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics

Unicode controls vs. markup for bidi support

How to use Unicode controls for bidi text


### 3.5 Blank Nodes

Blank nodes are disjoint from IRIs and literals .  Otherwise,
      the set of possible blank nodes is arbitrary.  RDF makes no reference to
      any internal structure of blank nodes.

Blank node equality :
      Two blank nodes are equal if and only if they are the same blank node.

Blank node identifiers are local identifiers that are used in some concrete RDF syntaxes or RDF store implementations.
      They are always locally scoped to the file or RDF store,
      and are not persistent or portable identifiers
      for blank nodes. Blank node identifiers are not part of the RDF abstract data model, but are entirely dependent
      on the concrete syntax or implementation. The syntactic restrictions
      on blank node identifiers, if any, therefore also depend on
      the concrete RDF syntax or implementation.  Implementations that handle blank node
      identifiers in concrete syntaxes need to be careful not to create the
      same blank node from multiple occurrences of the same blank node identifier
      except in situations where this is supported by the syntax.

The term "blank node label" is sometimes used informally
      as an alternative to the term blank node identifier .
      This alternative was also used in earlier versions of
      some RDF-related specifications such as [ SPARQL11-QUERY ].
      In the interest of consistency, the use of this alternative
      term is discouraged now.


### 3.6 Triple Terms

An RDF triple used as the object of another triple is called a triple term .
      In a given RDF graph , a triple can appear as a triple term , an asserted triple , or both.

Triple term equality:
      Since triple terms are triples , equality of triple terms is the same as triple equality .


### 3.7 Graph Comparison

This section introduces a notion of graph isomorphism for RDF graphs which is based on a mapping between RDF terms that maps blank nodes to blank nodes
      and is the identity function for IRIs and literals.

A function M from the set of all RDF terms into that same set
      is called an isomorphic RDF-term mapping if it is has all of the following properties:

M is bijective.

For every blank node b , M ( b ) is a blank node (but not necessarily the same as b ).

For every literal lit , M ( lit ) is lit .

For every IRI iri , M ( iri ) is iri .

For every triple term tt of the form ( s , p , o ), M ( tt ) is the triple term ( M ( s ), M ( p ), M ( o ) ).

Two RDF graphs G and G' are isomorphic (that is, they have the same form)
      if there exists an isomorphic RDF-term mapping M such that
      the triple ( s , p , o ) is in G if and only if
      the triple ( M ( s ), M ( p ), M ( o ) ) is in G' .

With this definition, M shows how each blank node
      in G can be replaced with
      a new blank node to give G' . Graph isomorphism
      is needed to support the RDF Test Cases [ RDF11-TESTCASES ] specification.


## 4. RDF Datasets

An RDF dataset is a collection of RDF graphs , and comprises:

Exactly one default graph , being an RDF graph .
      The default graph does not have a name and MAY be empty.

Zero or more named graphs .
      Each named graph is a pair consisting of an IRI or a blank node
      (the graph name ), and an RDF graph .
      Graph names are unique within an RDF dataset.

Blank nodes can be shared between graphs
    in an RDF dataset .

Despite the use of the word “name” in “ named graph ”, the graph name is not required to denote the graph. It is
      merely syntactically paired with the graph. RDF does not place any
      formal restrictions on what resource the graph name may denote,
      nor on the relationship between that resource and the graph.
      A discussion of different RDF dataset semantics can be found in
      [ RDF11-DATASETS ].

Some RDF dataset implementations do not
      track empty named graphs . Applications
      can avoid interoperability issues by not ascribing importance to
      the presence or absence of empty named graphs.

SPARQL version 1.2 [ SPARQL12-CONCEPTS ] uses the same concept of an RDF Dataset as RDF versions 1.1 and 1.2,
      in which the graph names of named graphs may be IRIs or blank nodes.
      In contrast, version 1.1 of the SPARQL Query Language [ SPARQL11-QUERY ]
      only allowed graph names to be IRIs.


### 4.1 RDF Dataset Comparison

Two RDF datasets D1 and D2 (respectively, with default graphs DG1 and DG2 and sets NG1 and NG2 of named graphs )
      are dataset-isomorphic if and only if
      there exists an isomorphic RDF-term mapping M for which all of the following properties hold:

The triple ( s , p , o ) is in DG1 if and only if
        the triple ( M ( s ), M ( p ), M ( o ) ) is in DG2 .

The named graph ( n , G ) is in NG1 if and only if
        there is a named graph ( n' , G' ) in NG2 such that
        the following are true: M ( n ) is equal to n' . For every triple t =( s , p , o ), it holds that t is in G if and only if
            the triple ( M ( s ), M ( p ), M ( o ) ) is in G' .

M ( n ) is equal to n' .

For every triple t =( s , p , o ), it holds that t is in G if and only if
            the triple ( M ( s ), M ( p ), M ( o ) ) is in G' .


### 4.2 Content Negotiation of RDF Datasets

This section is non-normative.

Web resources may have multiple representations that are made available via content negotiation [ WEBARCH ].  A representation may be returned in an RDF serialization
      format that supports the expression of both RDF datasets and RDF graphs .  If an RDF dataset is returned and the consumer is expecting an RDF graph ,
      the consumer is expected to use the RDF dataset's default graph.


### 4.3 Dataset as a Set of Quads

This section is non-normative.

A quad is a triple associated with an optional graph name and is used when referring to triples within an RDF dataset .

A quad can be represented as a tuple composed of subject , predicate , object ,
      and an optional graph name .

An RDF dataset can be considered to be a set of quads where quads with no graph name supply the triples of the default graph ,
      and quads with the same graph name
      supply the triples of the named graph with that name.

Although a quad without a graph name consists of the same three components as a triple ,
      it is a distinct concept,
      as it specifically captures the notion of a triple within the default graph of an RDF dataset .


## 5. Datatypes

Datatypes are used with RDF literals to represent values such as strings, numbers and dates.
    The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema
    [ XMLSCHEMA11-2 ]. Any datatype definition that conforms
    to this abstraction MAY be used in RDF, even if not defined
    in terms of XML Schema. RDF re-uses many of the XML Schema
    built-in datatypes, and defines three additional datatypes, rdf:JSON , rdf:HTML , and rdf:XMLLiteral .

A datatype consists of a lexical space ,
    a value space and a lexical-to-value mapping , and
    is identified by one or more IRIs .

The lexical space of a datatype is a set of strings .

The lexical-to-value mapping of a datatype is a set of
    pairs whose first element belongs to the lexical space ,
    and the second element belongs to the value space of the datatype. Each member of the lexical space is paired with exactly
    one value, and is a lexical representation of that value. The mapping can be seen as a function
    from the lexical space to the value space.

Language-tagged strings have the datatype IRI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString (commonly abbreviated as rdf:langString ).
    No datatype is formally defined for this IRI because the definition
    of datatypes does not accommodate language tags in the lexical space .
    The value space associated with this datatype IRI is the set
    of all pairs that consist of a string and a language tag.
    Similarly, directional language-tagged strings http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#dirLangString (commonly abbreviated as rdf:dirLangString )
    also have a base direction in the value space.
    The value space associated with this datatype IRI is the set
    of all 3-tuples of a string, a language tag and a base direction.

For example, the XML Schema datatype xsd:boolean ,
    where each member of the value space has two lexical
    representations, is defined as follows:

The literals that can be defined using this
    datatype are:


### 5.1 The XML Schema Built-in Datatypes

IRIs of the form http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# xxx ,
      where xxx is the name of a datatype, denote the built-in datatypes defined in W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes [ XMLSCHEMA11-2 ]. The XML Schema built-in types
      listed in the following table are the RDF-compatible XSD types . Their use is RECOMMENDED .

Readers might note that the only safe datatypes for transferring
      binary information are xsd:hexBinary and xsd:base64Binary .

The lexical-to-value mapping for xsd:float and xsd:double MUST use a method consistent with doubleLexicalMap ,
      which MUST strictly conform to the rounding method described in floatPtRound [ XMLSCHEMA11-2 ].

The other built-in XML Schema datatypes are unsuitable
      for various reasons and SHOULD NOT be used:

xsd:QName and xsd:ENTITY require an enclosing XML document context.

xsd:ID and xsd:IDREF are for cross references within an XML document.

xsd:NOTATION is not intended for direct use.

xsd:IDREFS , xsd:ENTITIES and xsd:NMTOKENS are sequence-valued datatypes which do not fit the RDF datatype model.

The value spaces of xsd:double and xsd:float do not
      include all decimal numbers. For every literal of
      either of these two datatypes, the value
      of the literal is a value that can be represented as an IEEE 754-2008 binary floating point representation of the corresponding precision.
      For instance, the literal with
      lexical form "0.1" and datatype xsd:float denotes the number 0.100000001490116119384765625 .
      Rather than xsd:double or xsd:float , the
      datatype xsd:decimal can be used to accurately capture arbitrary decimal numbers.


### 5.2 Datatype IRIs

Datatypes are identified by IRIs .

If any IRI of the form http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#xxx is handled by an RDF implementation, it MUST refer to the RDF-compatible XSD type named xsd:xxx for
      every XSD type listed in section 5.1 .

The datatypes identified by the three IRIs below are defined in
    Appendix A. Additional Datatypes :

The IRI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral refers to the datatype rdf:XMLLiteral .

The IRI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML refers to the datatype rdf:HTML .

The IRI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#JSON refers to the datatype rdf:JSON .

RDF implementations are not required to handle all datatypes.
      Any literal typed with a datatype not handled by an RDF implementation
      is treated just like an unknown IRI , i.e., as referring to an unknown thing.
      Applications MAY give a warning message if they are unable to determine the
      referent of an IRI used in a typed literal. RDF implementations SHOULD NOT reject a literal with an unknown datatype as either a syntactic or
      semantic error.

Other specifications MAY impose additional constraints on datatype IRIs , for example, require support
      for certain datatypes.

Semantic extensions of RDF might choose to
      recognize other datatype IRIs
      and require each of them to refer to a fixed datatype.
      See RDF 1.2 Semantics [ RDF12-SEMANTICS ] for more information on
      semantic extensions.

The Web Ontology Language
      [ OWL2-OVERVIEW ] offers facilities for formally defining custom
      datatypes that can be used with RDF. Furthermore, a practice for
      identifying user-defined simple XML Schema datatypes is suggested in [ SWBP-XSCH-DATATYPES ]. RDF implementations
      are not required to support either of these facilities.

In RDF 1.1, Recognized datatype IRIs were defined in RDF Concepts, overlapping with RDF Semantics, "recognizing" datatype IRIs for semantic extensions .


## 6. Fragment Identifiers

This section is non-normative.

RDF uses IRIs , which may include fragment identifiers ,
    as resource identifiers.
    The semantics of fragment identifiers is defined in
    RFC 3986 [ RFC3986 ]: They identify a secondary resource
    that is usually a part of, a view of, defined in, or described in
    the primary resource, and the precise semantics depend on the set
    of representations that might result from a retrieval action
    on the primary resource.

This section discusses the handling of fragment identifiers
    in representations that encode RDF graphs .

In RDF-bearing representations of a primary resource, e.g., <https://example.com/foo> ,
    the secondary resource identified by a fragment identifier, e.g., bar ,
    is the resource denoted by the
    full IRI in the RDF graph , which would be <https://example.com/foo#bar> in this case.
    Since IRIs in RDF graphs can denote anything, this can be
    something external to the representation, or even external
    to the web.

In this way, the RDF-bearing representation acts as an intermediary
    between the web-accessible primary resource and some set of possibly
    non-web or abstract entities that the RDF graph may describe.

In cases where other specifications constrain the semantics of fragment identifiers in RDF-bearing representations, the encoded RDF graph should use fragment identifiers in a way that is consistent
    with these constraints. For example, in an HTML+RDFa document [ HTML-RDFA ],
    a fragment identifier such as chapter1 may identify a document section
    via the semantics of HTML's @name or @id attributes. Such an IRI , e.g., <#chapter1> , should
    then be taken to denote that same section in any RDFa-encoded triples within the same document.
    Similarly, fragment identifiers should be used consistently in resources
    with multiple representations that are made available via content negotiation [ WEBARCH ]. For example, if the fragment identifier chapter1 identifies a
    document section in an HTML representation of the primary resource, then the IRI <#chapter1> should be taken to denote that same section in all RDF-bearing representations of the
    same primary resource.


## 7. Generalizations of RDF Triples, Graphs, and Datasets

This section is non-normative.

It is sometimes convenient to loosen the requirements
    on RDF triples .  For example, the completeness
    of the RDFS entailment rules is easier to show with
    a notion of symmetric RDF triples.


### 7.1 Symmetric RDF

A symmetric RDF triple allows the subject to be
    any RDF term that is allowed in the object position, one of
    an IRI ,
    a blank node ,
    a literal ,
    or a triple term (which may itself be a symmetric RDF triple).
    A symmetric RDF graph is a set of symmetric RDF triples.
    A symmetric RDF dataset comprises a distinguished symmetric RDF graph, and zero
    or more pairs that each associate an IRI or a blank node with a symmetric RDF graph.

Symmetric RDF triples, graphs, and datasets differ
    from standard, normative RDF triples , graphs , and datasets only by allowing IRIs , blank nodes , literals ,
    and triple terms in the subject and object positions.


### 7.2 Generalized RDF

A generalized RDF triple is a triple having a subject,
    a predicate, and an object, where each can be an IRI ,
    a blank node ,
    a literal ,
    or a triple term (which may itself be a generalized RDF triple).
    A generalized RDF graph is a set of generalized RDF triples. A generalized RDF dataset comprises a distinguished generalized RDF graph, and zero
    or more pairs each associating an IRI ,
    a blank node ,
    a literal ,
    or a triple term (which may itself be a generalized RDF triple),
    to a generalized RDF graph.

Generalized RDF triples, graphs, and datasets differ
    from standard, normative RDF triples , graphs , and datasets only
    by allowing IRIs , blank nodes , literals , and triple terms to appear
    in any position, i.e., as subject, predicate, object, or graph name.

Any user of
    symmetric or generalized RDF triples, graphs, or datasets needs to be
    aware that these notions are non-standard extensions of
    RDF, and their use may cause interoperability problems.
    There is no requirement for any RDF tool to
    accept, process, or produce anything beyond standard
    normative RDF triples, graphs, and datasets.


## A. Additional Datatypes

This section defines additional datatypes that RDF implementations MAY support.


### A.1 The rdf:HTML Datatype

RDF provides for HTML content as a possible literal value .
      This allows markup in literal values. Such content is indicated
      in an RDF graph using a literal whose datatype is set to rdf:HTML .

The rdf:HTML datatype is defined as follows:

Each member of the lexical space is associated with the result
          of applying the following algorithm:

Let domnodes be the list of DOM nodes [ DOM ]
            that result from applying the HTML fragment parsing algorithm [ HTML5 ]
            to the input string, without a context element.

Let domfrag be a DOM DocumentFragment [ DOM ]
            whose childNodes attribute is equal to domnodes

Return domfrag. normalize () .

Any language annotation ( lang="…" ),
      text directionality annotation ( dir="…" ), or
      XML namespaces ( xmlns ) desired in the HTML content
      must be included explicitly in the HTML literal. Relative URLs
      in attributes such as href do not have a well-defined
      base URL and are best avoided.
      RDF applications may use additional equivalence relations,
      such as that which relates an xsd:string with an rdf:HTML literal corresponding to a single text node
      of the same string.


### A.2 The rdf:XMLLiteral Datatype

RDF provides for XML content as a possible literal value .
      Such content is indicated in an RDF graph using a literal whose datatype is set to rdf:XMLLiteral .

The rdf:XMLLiteral datatype is defined as follows:

Each member of the lexical space is associated with the result of applying the following algorithm:

Let domfrag be a DOM DocumentFragment node [ DOM ] corresponding to the input string.

Return domfrag. normalize () .

Any XML namespace declarations ( xmlns ),
      language annotation ( xml:lang ) or base URI declarations
      ( xml:base ) desired in the XML content must be included
      explicitly in the XML literal. Note that some concrete RDF syntaxes
      may define mechanisms for inheriting them from the context (e.g., @parseType="literal" in RDF/XML [ RDF12-XML ].


### A.3 The rdf:JSON Datatype

RDF provides for JSON content as a possible literal value .
      This includes allowing markup in literal values. Such content is indicated in an RDF graph as a literal whose datatype is set
      to rdf:JSON .

The rdf:JSON datatype is defined as follows:

The value space of finite unordered maps
          and lists does not include values having themselves as members,
          which cannot be represented in JSON.

Two values are considered equal if and only if they are the same element of the value space.

A JSON Object is mapped to a finite unordered map
            by transforming each object member into a map entry with the key taken from the member name and value taken by performing this mapping
            to the member value.

A JSON Array is mapped to a list such that this list contains as many
            elements as the JSON Array and, for
            every position i in the array ,
            the element at the i -th position in the list is the value that results from
            applying this mapping to the i -th element of the array .

A JSON Number is mapped to
            an xsd:double using a method consistent with doubleLexicalMap ,
            which MUST strictly conform to the rounding method described in floatPtRound [ XMLSCHEMA11-2 ]. Note Some numbers cannot be represented
              as finite xsd:double values
              and may map to +INF or -INF .
              Such values cannot be represented as JSON Numbers, limiting the ability to serialize such values back to JSON.

A JSON String is mapped to
            a string after converting any escape sequences to the associated Unicode code point .

A JSON literal name maps
            JSON true , false , and null values
            to [ INFRA ] true , false , and null values, respectively.

The finite unordered maps can be implemented with ordered maps [ INFRA ]
      by systematically sorting key-value pairs by key (using Unicode code point order).
      This ensures that lexical forms that differ only in the order of object members (e.g., {"a": "b", "c": "d"} and {"c": "d", "a": "b"} ) are mapped to the same value.


## B. Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs

Blank nodes do not have identifiers in the RDF abstract data model. The blank node identifiers introduced
    by some concrete syntaxes have only
    local scope and are purely an artifact of the serialization.

In situations where stronger identification is needed, systems MAY systematically replace some or all of the blank nodes in an RDF graph
    with IRIs .  Systems wishing to do this SHOULD mint a new, globally
    unique IRI (a Skolem IRI ) for each blank node so replaced.

This transformation produces a new graph which entails the original one (see also Skolemization ) .
    In this context it is important to note that Skolem IRIs and blank nodes are
    different in nature: while IRIs directly denote resources, blank nodes only indicate 
    the existence of a resource. By producing Skolem IRIs, we create concrete witnesses of this existence.    
	As Skolem IRIs are not local, this permits other graphs
    to subsequently use them, which is not possible
    with blank nodes.

Systems may wish to mint Skolem IRIs in such a way that they can
    recognize the IRIs as having been introduced solely to replace blank
    nodes. In some contexts, this allows a system to map Skolem IRIs back to blank nodes
    if needed.

Systems that want Skolem IRIs to be recognizable outside of the system
    boundaries SHOULD use a well-known IRI [ RFC8615 ] with the registered
    name genid . This is an IRI that uses the HTTP or HTTPS scheme,
    or another scheme that has been specified to use well-known IRIs, and whose
    path component starts with /.well-known/genid/ .

For example, the authority responsible for the domain example.com could mint the following recognizable Skolem IRI :

http : //example.com/.well-known/genid/d26a2d0e98334696f4ad70a677abc1f6

RFC 8615 [ RFC8615 ] only specifies well-known URIs,
    not IRIs. For the purpose of this document, a well-known IRI is any IRI that results in a well-known URI after IRI -to- URI mapping [ RFC3987 ].


## C. Privacy Considerations

This section is non-normative.

RDF is used to express arbitrary application data,
    which may include the expression of personally identifiable information (PII)
    or other information which could be considered sensitive.
    Authors publishing such information are advised to carefully
    consider the needs and use of publishing such information,
    as well as the applicable regulations for the regions where the data is
    expected to be consumed and potentially revealed (e.g., GDPR , CCPA , others ),
    particularly whether authorization measures are needed for access to the data.


## D. Security Considerations

This section is non-normative.

The RDF Abstract Data Model is not used directly for conveying information.
    Concrete serialization forms are specifically intended to do so.

Applications can evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to dereference IRIs ,
    invoking the security considerations of the scheme for that IRI .
    Note in particular, the privacy issues in [ RFC3023 ] section 10 for HTTP IRIs.
    Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions,
    as well as the dereferencing of unintended IRIs.
    Care must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of
    the intended use of the data;
    inferences of potential medical treatments would likely require different trust than inferences
    for trip planning.

RDF is used to express arbitrary application data;
    security considerations will vary by domain of use.
    Security tools and protocols applicable to text
    (for example, PGP encryption, checksum validation, password-protected compression)
    can also be used on RDF documents.
    Security/privacy protocols ought to be imposed which reflect the sensitivity of the embedded information.

RDF can express data which is presented to the user, such as RDF Schema labels.
    Applications rendering strings retrieved from untrusted RDF documents,
    or using unescaped characters,
    ought to use warnings and other appropriate means to limit the possibility
    that malignant strings might be used to mislead the reader.
    The security considerations in the media type registration for XML ([ RFC3023 ] section 10)
    provide additional guidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup.

RDF uses IRIs as term identifiers.
    Applications interpreting data expressed in RDF ought to address the security issues of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [ RFC3987 ] Section 8, as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [ RFC3986 ] Section 7.

Multiple IRIs can have the same appearance.
     Characters in different scripts can look similar (for instance,
     a Cyrillic "о" can appear similar to a Latin "o").
     A character followed by combining characters can have the same visual representation
     as another character (for example, LATIN SMALL LETTER "E" followed by COMBINING ACUTE
     ACCENT has the same visual representation as LATIN SMALL LETTER "E" WITH ACUTE).
     Any person or application that is writing or interpreting data in RDF
     must take care to use the IRI that matches the intended semantics,
     and avoid IRIs that may look similar.
     Further information about matching visually similar characters can be found
     in Unicode Security Considerations [ UNICODE-SECURITY ] and Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [ RFC3987 ] Section 8.

Comparing graphs,
    or reasoning with them,
    often relies on computing (sub)graph isomorphism ,
    which is known to be computationally complex in the worst case. Querying graphs can also involve computationally complex operations.
    This means that malicious graphs can be constructed to cause RDF implementations to stall or run out of memory.
    Implementations processing graphs from untrusted sources are expected to provide mitigations;
    examples are given in the section on Dataset Poisoning in [ RDF-CANON ].

These considerations are a more generic form
    of Security Considerations for [ RDF12-TURTLE ], [ RDF12-TRIG ], [ RDF12-N-TRIPLES ],
    and [ RDF12-N-QUADS ].


## E. Internationalization Considerations

This section is non-normative.

Unicode [ UNICODE ] provides a mechanism for signaling direction within a string
    (see Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [ I18N-Glossary ]).
    RDF provides a mechanism for specifying the base direction of a directional language-tagged string to signal the initial text direction of a string.
    For most human language strings, but particularly for those
    whose base direction cannot be accurately determined from the 
    string content, is it valuable to have an external indicator in order
    to get the proper display and isolation of the value.
    One example of such an indicator is
    the [ HTML ] dir attribute ;
    see [ STRING-META ].

JSON-LD 1.1 [ JSON-LD11 ] introduced the i18n namespace to use
    a datatype to specify both the base direction an language tag of an RDF literal .


## F. IRI Grammar

This section is non-normative.

The following [ ABNF ] grammar applies the changes from [ RFC3987 ] and [ RFC6874 ] to the section Collected ABNF for URI of
    [ RFC3986 ] to give a consolidated grammar for IRIs.

This is provided for convenience only.
    If it differs from definitions in [ RFC3986 ], [ RFC3987 ], or any subsequent updates,
    then those definitions should be used.

IRI = scheme ":" ihier-part [ "?" iquery ] [ "#" ifragment ] ihier-part = "//" iauthority ipath-abempty
               / ipath-absolute
               / ipath-rootless
               / ipath-empty IRI-reference = IRI / irelative-ref absolute-IRI = scheme ":" ihier-part [ "?" iquery ] irelative-ref = irelative-part [ "?" iquery ] [ "#" ifragment ] irelative-part = "//" iauthority ipath-abempty

## H. Changes between RDF 1.1 and RDF 1.2

This section is non-normative.

Added 1.10 RDF Version Announcement for announcing RDF versions in RDF documents via the HTTP Content-Type header and/or syntax.

Added 4.3 Dataset as a Set of Quads for informative definition of a quad .

Added 1.5 Triple Terms and Reification and definitions for triple term and asserted triple and extended the definition of RDF triple to permit triple terms as objects.
      Also defines reifier and reifying triple .

Added the base direction component as part of
      a literal ,
      and a description of its use in 3.4.3 Initial Text Direction .

Improved the use of IRI terminology,
      and added F. IRI Grammar .
      This improves the language using relative IRI references and clarifies that, in the abstract syntax, IRIs are resolved,
      avoiding the incorrect use of "absolute IRI ".

Changed reference from DOM4, which was not a recommendation at the time, to [ DOM ],
      making the definitions of rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral datatypes normative.

Added A. Additional Datatypes and moved the sections about the rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral datatypes to this appendix.

Added the rdf:JSON datatype, the definition of which is adopted
      from Section 10.2 The rdf:JSON Datatype in [ JSON-LD11 ].
      Note that the value space defined here
      updates the value space of the rdf:JSON datatype defined in JSON-LD 1.1 [ JSON-LD11 ]

Clarify Unicode terminology,
      using Unicode code points ,
      and restriction to the XML Char production.
      Also removes obsolete recommendations for the use of Normalization Form C in literals.
      Adds a definition of string that can be used in other RDF documents.

Minor edit
      to improve the example about distinguishing literals, IRIs, and blank nodes
      in 3.1 Triples .

Implementations were previously allowed to normalize language tags to lower case,
      which made it ambiguous whether two literals with language tags
      that differed only by case represented the same literal,
      or distinct literals.
      RDF 1.2 requires that language tags be case-insensitively unique 
      but does not specify the common formatting to be used.
      Two literals with the same lexical form and language tags that differ only by case
      are the same literal.
      Implementations can either follow the advice to normalize to lower case,
      use the recommended BCP47 format,
      or do something else, as long it is performed consistently.

Added explicit definitions of blank node equality , RDF term equality , and triple equality .

Removed the section on the canonical mapping for the rdf:XMLLiteral datatype.

Refer to the definition and discussion of RDF Semantics, "recognizing" datatype IRIs, instead of Recognized datatype IRIs .

The informal terminology "RDF processor" has been removed.

A detailed overview of the differences between RDF versions 1.1
    and 1.2 can be found in What’s New in RDF 1.2 [ RDF12-NEW ].
