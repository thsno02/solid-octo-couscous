## Abstract

JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.
    This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize
    Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed
    systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from
    JSON to JSON-LD.
    It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based
    programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to
    store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.

This specification describes a superset of the features defined in JSON-LD 1.0 [ JSON-LD10 ]
    and, except where noted,
    documents created using the 1.0 version of this specification remain compatible with JSON-LD 1.1.

## 1. Introduction

This section is non-normative.

Linked Data [ LINKED-DATA ] is a way to create a network of
   standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and
   Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data,
   and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on
   different sites across the Web.

JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in
    JSON [ RFC8259 ]. Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as
    Linked Data with minimal changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a
    way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
    interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since
    JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON, the large number of JSON parsers and libraries
    available today can be reused. In addition to all the features JSON provides,
    JSON-LD introduces:

a universal identifier mechanism for JSON objects via the use of IRIs ,

a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping
      them to IRIs via a context ,

a mechanism in which a value in a JSON object may refer
      to a resource on a different site on the Web,

the ability to annotate strings with their language,

a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,

and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
      network, in a single document.

JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON, with no knowledge of RDF
   [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ]. It is also designed to be usable as RDF
   in conjunction with other Linked Data technologies like SPARQL [ SPARQL11-OVERVIEW ].
   Developers who
   require any of the facilities listed above or need to serialize an RDF graph or Dataset in a JSON-based syntax will find JSON-LD of interest. People
   intending to use JSON-LD with RDF tools will find it can be used as another
   RDF syntax, as with [ Turtle ] and [ TriG ]. Complete details of how JSON-LD relates
   to RDF are in section § 10. Relationship to RDF .

The syntax is designed to not disturb already
   deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from
   JSON to JSON-LD. Since the shape of such data varies wildly, JSON-LD
   features mechanisms to reshape documents into a deterministic structure
   which simplifies their processing.


### 1.1 How to Read this Document

This section is non-normative.

This document is a detailed specification for a serialization of Linked
      Data in JSON. The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

Software developers who want to encode Linked Data in a variety of
        programming languages that can use JSON

Software developers who want to convert existing JSON to JSON-LD

Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        language syntax for JSON-LD

Software developers who want to implement processors and APIs for
        JSON-LD

Software developers who want to generate or consume Linked Data,
        an RDF graph , or an RDF Dataset in a JSON syntax

A companion document, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification
      [ JSON-LD11-API ], specifies how to work with JSON-LD at a higher level by
      providing a standard library interface for common JSON-LD operations.

To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with JSON , which is detailed in [ RFC8259 ].

This document almost exclusively uses the term IRI ( Internationalized Resource Indicator )
      when discussing hyperlinks. Many Web developers are more familiar with the
      URL ( Uniform Resource Locator )
      terminology. The document also uses, albeit rarely, the URI
      ( Uniform Resource Indicator )
      terminology. While these terms are often used interchangeably among
      technical communities, they do have important distinctions from one
      another and the specification goes to great lengths to try and use the
      proper terminology at all times.

This document can highlight changes since the JSON-LD 1.0 version.

The working group uses #json-ld IRC channel is available for real-time discussion on irc.w3.org .

The #json-ld IRC channel is also available for real-time discussion on irc.freenode.net.


### 1.3 Typographical conventions

This section is non-normative.

The following typographic conventions are used in this specification:

Notes are in light green boxes with a green left border and with a "Note" header in green.
  Notes are always informative.

Examples are in light khaki boxes, with khaki left border,
and with a numbered "Example" header in khaki.
Examples are always informative. The content of the example is in monospace font and may be syntax colored.

Examples may have tabbed navigation buttons
to show the results of transforming an example into other representations.


### 1.4 Terminology

This section is non-normative.

This document uses the following terms as defined in external specifications
      and defines terms specific to JSON-LD.


#### Terms imported from Other Specifications

Terms imported from ECMAScript Language Specification [ ECMASCRIPT ], The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format [ RFC8259 ], Infra Standard [ INFRA ], and Web IDL [ WEBIDL ]

In the internal representation a JSON object is described as a map (see [ INFRA ]),
      composed of entries with key/value pairs.

In the Application Programming Interface ,
      a map is described using a [ WEBIDL ] record .

Terms imported from Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [ RFC3987 ]

Terms imported from RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ], RDF Schema 1.1 [ RDF-SCHEMA ], and Linked Data Design Issues [ LINKED-DATA ]


#### JSON-LD Specific Term Definitions

it does not contain the @value , @list , or @set keywords, or

it is not the top-most map in the JSON-LD document
        consisting of no other entries than @graph and @context .


### 1.5 Design Goals and Rationale

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD satisfies the following design goals:


### 1.6 Data Model Overview

This section is non-normative.

Generally speaking, the data model described by a JSON-LD document is a labeled, directed graph .
      The graph contains nodes , which are connected by directed-arcs.
      A node is either a resource with properties , or the data values of those properties including strings , numbers , typed values (like dates and times) and IRIs .

Within a directed graph, nodes are resources , and may
      be unnamed , i.e., not identified by an IRI ;
      which are called blank nodes ,
      and may be identified using a blank node identifier .
      These identifiers may be required to represent a fully connected graph
      using a tree structure, such as JSON, but otherwise have no
      intrinsic meaning.
      Literal values, such as strings and numbers , are also considered resources ,
      and JSON-LD distinguishes between node objects and value objects to distinguish between the different
      kinds of resource .

This simple data model is incredibly
      flexible and powerful, capable of modeling almost any kind of
      data. For a deeper explanation of the data model, see
      section § 8. Data Model .

Developers who are familiar with Linked Data technologies will
      recognize the data model as the RDF Data Model. To dive deeper into how
      JSON-LD and RDF are related, see
      section § 10. Relationship to RDF .

At the surface level, a JSON-LD document is simply JSON , detailed in [ RFC8259 ].
      For the purpose of describing the core data structures,
      this is limited to arrays , maps (the parsed version of a JSON Object ), strings , numbers , booleans , and null , called the JSON-LD internal representation .
        This allows surface syntaxes other than JSON
        to be manipulated using the same algorithms, when the syntax maps
        to equivalent core data structures .

Although not discussed in this specification,
        parallel work using YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML™) Version 1.2 [ YAML ]
        and binary representations such as Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [ RFC7049 ]
        could be used to map into the internal representation , allowing
        the JSON-LD 1.1 API [ JSON-LD11-API ] to operate as if the source was a
        JSON document.


### 1.7 Syntax Tokens and Keywords

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD specifies a number of syntax tokens and keywords that are a core part of the language.
    A normative description of the keywords is given in § 9.16 Keywords .

§ 4.3 Value Ordering ,

§ 4.6.1 Data Indexing ,

§ 4.6.2 Language Indexing ,

§ 4.6.3 Node Identifier Indexing ,

§ 4.6.4 Node Type Indexing

§ 4.9 Named Graphs ,

§ 4.9.3 Named Graph Indexing , and

§ 4.9.2 Named Graph Data Indexing

All keys, keywords , and values in JSON-LD are case-sensitive.


## 2. Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY , MUST , MUST NOT , RECOMMENDED , SHOULD , and SHOULD NOT in this document
        are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [ RFC2119 ] [ RFC8174 ]
        when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

A JSON-LD document complies with this specification if it follows
    the normative statements in appendix § 9. JSON-LD Grammar . JSON documents
    can be interpreted as JSON-LD by following the normative statements in § 6.1 Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD . For convenience, normative
    statements for documents are often phrased as statements on the properties of the document.

This specification makes use of the following namespace prefixes:

These are used within this document as part of a compact IRI as a shorthand for the resulting IRI , such as dcterms:title used to represent http://purl.org/dc/terms/title .


## 3. Basic Concepts

This section is non-normative.

JSON [ RFC8259 ] is a lightweight, language-independent data interchange format.
    It is easy to parse and easy to generate. However, it is difficult to integrate JSON
    from different sources as the data may contain keys that conflict with other
    data sources. Furthermore, JSON has no
    built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building block on
    the Web. Let's start by looking at an example that we will be using for the
    rest of this section:

{ "name" : "Manu Sporny" , "homepage" : "http://manu.sporny.org/" , "image" : "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" }

It's obvious to humans that the data is about a person whose name is "Manu Sporny"
    and that the homepage property contains the URL of that person's homepage.
    A machine doesn't have such an intuitive understanding and sometimes,
    even for humans, it is difficult to resolve ambiguities in such representations. This problem
    can be solved by using unambiguous identifiers to denote the different concepts instead of
    tokens such as "name", "homepage", etc.

Linked Data, and the Web in general, uses IRIs ( Internationalized Resource Identifiers as described in [ RFC3987 ]) for unambiguous
    identification. The idea is to use IRIs to assign unambiguous identifiers to data that may be of use to other developers.
    It is useful for terms ,
    like name and homepage , to expand to IRIs so that developers don't accidentally step on each other's terms. Furthermore, developers and
    machines are able to use this IRI (by using a web browser, for instance) to go to
    the term and get a definition of what the term means. This process is known as IRI dereferencing.

Leveraging the popular schema.org vocabulary ,
    the example above could be unambiguously expressed as follows:

{
  " http://schema.org/name ": "Manu Sporny",
  " http://schema.org/url ": {
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/" ↑ The '@id' keyword means 'This value is an identifier that is an IRI' } ,
  " http://schema.org/image ": {
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" } }

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   schema:image <http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png>;
   schema:name "Manu Sporny";
   schema:url <http://manu.sporny.org/>
 ] .

In the example above, every property is unambiguously identified by an IRI and all values
    representing IRIs are explicitly marked as such by the @id keyword . While this is a valid JSON-LD
    document that is very specific about its data, the document is also overly verbose and difficult
    to work with for human developers. To address this issue, JSON-LD introduces the notion
    of a context as described in the next section.

This section only covers the most basic features of JSON-LD. More advanced features,
    including typed values , indexed values , and named graphs ,
    can be found in § 4. Advanced Concepts .


### 3.1 The Context

This section is non-normative.

When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes
    place in a shared environment, typically called
    "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the
    individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend,
    to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in
    JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut
    terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without
    losing accuracy.

Simply speaking, a context is used to map terms to IRIs . Terms are case sensitive and most valid strings that are not reserved JSON-LD keywords can be used as a term . Exceptions are the empty string "" and strings that have the form
        of a keyword (i.e., starting with "@" followed exclusively by one or more ALPHA characters (see [ RFC5234 ])), which must not be used as terms.
        Strings that have the form of
        an IRI (e.g., containing a ":" ) should not be used as terms.

For the sample document in the previous section, a context would
      look something like this:

{ "@context": {
    "name": "http://schema.org/name", ↑ This means that 'name' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/name' "image": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/image", ↑ This means that 'image' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/image' "@type": "@id" ↑ This means that a string value associated with 'image'
        should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/url", ↑ This means that 'homepage' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/url' "@type": "@id" ↑ This means that a string value associated with 'homepage'
        should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI }
  } }

As the context above shows, the value of a term definition can
      either be a simple string, mapping the term to an IRI ,
      or a map .

A context is introduced using an entry with the key @context and may
      appear within a node object or a value object .

When an entry with a term key has a map value, the map is called
      an expanded term definition . The example above specifies that
      the values of image and homepage , if they are
      strings, are to be interpreted as IRIs . Expanded term definitions also allow terms to be used for index maps and to specify whether array values are to be
      interpreted as sets or lists . Expanded term definitions may
      be defined using IRIs or compact IRIs as keys, which is
      mainly used to associate type or language information with an IRIs or compact IRI .

Contexts can either be directly embedded
      into the document (an embedded context ) or be referenced using a URL.
      Assuming the context document in the previous
      example can be retrieved at https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld ,
      it can be referenced by adding a single line and allows a JSON-LD document to
      be expressed much more concisely as shown in the example below:

{ "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld", "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
}

[{
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [{ "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/" }],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/img": [{ "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" }]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
   foaf:homepage <http://manu.sporny.org/>;
   foaf:img <http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png>
 ] .

The referenced context not only specifies how the terms map to IRIs in the Schema.org vocabulary but also
      specifies that string values associated with
      the homepage and image property
      can be interpreted as an IRI ( "@type": "@id" ,
      see § 3.2 IRIs for more details). This information allows developers
      to re-use each other's data without having to agree to how their data will interoperate
      on a site-by-site basis. External JSON-LD context documents may contain extra
      information located outside of the @context key, such as
      documentation about the terms declared in the
      document. Information contained outside of the @context value
      is ignored when the document is used as an external JSON-LD context document .

A remote context may also be referenced using a relative URL,
      which is resolved relative to the location of the document containing the reference.
      For example, if a document were located at http://example.org/document.jsonld and contained a relative reference to context.jsonld ,
      the referenced context document would be found relative at http://example.org/context.jsonld .

{ "@context": "context.jsonld", "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
}

Resolution of relative references to context URLs also applies to remote
      context documents, as they may themselves contain references to other contexts.

JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD without having to be modified by
      referencing a context via an HTTP Link Header as described in § 6.1 Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD . It is also
      possible to apply a custom context using the JSON-LD 1.1 API [ JSON-LD11-API ].

In JSON-LD documents , contexts may also be specified inline.
      This has the advantage that documents can be processed even in the
      absence of a connection to the Web. Ultimately, this is a modeling decision
      and different use cases may require different handling.
      See Security Considerations in § C. IANA Considerations for a discussion on using remote contexts.

{ "@context": {
    "name": "http://schema.org/name",
    "image": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/image",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/url",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }, "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
}

[{
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
  "http://schema.org/url": [{ "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/" }],
  "http://schema.org/image": [{ "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" }]
}]

   schema:image <http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png>;
   schema:name "Manu Sporny";
   schema:url <http://manu.sporny.org/>
 ] .

This section only covers the most basic features of the JSON-LD Context.
      The Context can also be used to help interpret other more
      complex JSON data structures, such as indexed values , ordered values , and nested properties .
      More advanced features related to the JSON-LD Context are covered in § 4. Advanced Concepts .


### 3.2 IRIs

This section is non-normative.

IRIs ( Internationalized Resource Identifiers [ RFC3987 ]) are fundamental to Linked Data as that is how most nodes and properties are identified.
    In JSON-LD, IRIs may be represented as an IRI reference .
    An IRI is defined in [ RFC3987 ] as containing a scheme along with path and optional query and fragment segments. A relative IRI reference is an IRI that is relative to some other IRI .
    In JSON-LD, with exceptions that are as described below, all relative IRI references are resolved relative to the base IRI .

As noted in § 1.1 How to Read this Document ,
    IRIs can often be confused with URLs ( Uniform Resource Locators ),
    the primary distinction is that a URL locates a resource on the web,
    an IRI identifies a resource. While it is a good practice for resource identifiers
    to be dereferenceable, sometimes this is not practical. In particular, note the
    [ URN ] scheme for Uniform Resource Names, such as UUID .
    An example UUID is urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6 .

Properties , values of @type ,
    and values of properties with a term definition that defines them as being relative to the vocabulary mapping ,
    may have the form of a relative IRI reference , but are resolved using the vocabulary mapping , and not the base IRI .

A string is interpreted as an IRI when it is the
    value of a map entry with the key @id :

{ ... "homepage": { " @id ": "http://example.com/" } ... }

Values that are interpreted as IRIs , can also be
    expressed as relative IRI references . For example,
    assuming that the following document is located at http://example.com/about/ , the relative IRI reference ../ would expand to http://example.com/ (for more
    information on where relative IRI references can be
    used, please refer to section § 9. JSON-LD Grammar ).

{ ... "homepage": { " @id ": "../" } ... }

IRIs can be expressed directly in the key position like so:

{ ... " http://schema.org/name ": "Manu Sporny" ,
  ... }

In the example above, the key http://schema.org/name is interpreted as an IRI .

Term-to- IRI expansion occurs if the key matches a term defined
    within the active context :

{
  " @context ": {
    " name ": " http://schema.org/name "
  },
  " name ": "Manu Sporny",
  "status": "trollin'"
}

[{
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   schema:name "Manu Sporny"
 ] .

JSON keys that do not expand to an IRI , such as status in the example above, are not Linked Data and thus ignored when processed.

If type coercion rules are specified in the @context for
    a particular term or property IRI , an IRI is generated:

{ "@context": { ... "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://schema.org/url",
      "@type": "@id"
    } ... }, ... "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/" ... }

[{
  "http://schema.org/url": [{"@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"}]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   schema:url <http://manu.sporny.org/>
 ] .

In the example above, since the value http://manu.sporny.org/ is expressed as a JSON string , the type coercion rules will transform the value into an IRI when processing the data.
    See § 4.2.3 Type Coercion for more
    details about this feature.

In summary, IRIs can be expressed in a variety of
    different ways in JSON-LD:

Map entries that have a key mapping to a term in
      the active context expand to an IRI (only applies outside of the context definition ).

An IRI is generated for the string value specified using @id or @type .

An IRI is generated for the string value of any key for which there
      are coercion rules that contain an @type key that is
      set to a value of @id or @vocab .

This section only covers the most basic features associated with IRIs
  in JSON-LD. More advanced features related to IRIs are covered in
  section § 4. Advanced Concepts .


### 3.3 Node Identifiers

This section is non-normative.

To be able to externally reference nodes in an RDF graph , it is important that nodes have an identifier. IRIs are a fundamental concept of Linked Data, for nodes to be truly linked, dereferencing the
    identifier should result in a representation of that node .
    This may allow an application to retrieve further information about a node .

In JSON-LD, a node is identified using the @id keyword :

{
  "@context": { ... "name": "http://schema.org/name"
  }, "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/" ,
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler" ,
  ... }

[{ "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/", "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Markus Lanthaler"}]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> schema:name "Markus Lanthaler" .

The example above contains a node object identified by the IRI http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/ .

This section only covers the most basic features associated with
  node identifiers in JSON-LD. More advanced features related to
  node identifiers are covered in section § 4. Advanced Concepts .


### 3.4 Uses of JSON Objects

This section is non-normative.

As a syntax, JSON has only a limited number of syntactic elements:

Numbers , which describe literal numeric values,

Strings , which may describe literal string values, or be used as the keys in a JSON object .

Boolean true and false , which describe literal boolean values,

null , which describes the absence of a value,

Arrays , which describe an ordered set of values of any type, and

JSON objects , which provide a set of map entries , relating keys with values.

The JSON-LD data model allows for a richer set of resources, based on the RDF data model.
    The data model is described more fully in § 8. Data Model .
    JSON-LD uses JSON objects to describe various resources, along with the relationships
    between these resources:


### 3.5 Specifying the Type

This section is non-normative.

In Linked Data, it is common to specify the type of a graph node;
    in many cases, this can be inferred based on the properties used within a
    given node object , or the property for which a node is a value. For
    example, in the schema.org vocabulary, the givenName property is associated with a Person . Therefore, one may reason that
    if a node object contains the property givenName , that the
    type is a Person ; making this explicit with @type helps
    to clarify the association.

The type of a particular node can be specified using the @type keyword . In Linked Data, types are uniquely
    identified with an IRI .

{
  "@context": { ... "givenName": "http://schema.org/givenName",
    "familyName": "http://schema.org/familyName"
  },
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/", "@type": "http://schema.org/Person", "givenName": "Markus",
  "familyName": "Lanthaler" ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/", "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"], "http://schema.org/givenName": [{"@value": "Markus"}],
  "http://schema.org/familyName": [{"@value": "Lanthaler"}]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> a schema:Person ;
  schema:givenName "Markus";
  schema:familyName "Lanthaler" .

A node can be assigned more than one type by using an array :

{ ... "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "@type": [ "http://schema.org/Person", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"
    ] ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person" ]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> a schema:Person, foaf:Person .

The value of a @type key may also be a term defined in the active context :

{
  "@context": { ... "Person": "http://schema.org/Person" },
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats", "@type": "Person" ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": [ "http://schema.org/Person" ]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://example.org/places#BrewEats> a schema:Person .

In addition to setting the type of nodes, @type can also be used to set the type of a value
    to create a typed value .
    This use of @type is similar to that used to define the type of a node object ,
    but value objects are restricted to having just a single type.
    The use of @type to create typed values is discussed more fully in § 4.2.1 Typed Values .

Typed values can also be defined implicitly, by specifying @type in an expanded term definition.
    This is covered more fully in § 4.2.3 Type Coercion .


## 4. Advanced Concepts

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD has a number of features that provide functionality above and beyond
  the core functionality described above. JSON can be used to express data
  using such structures, and the features described in this
  section can be used to interpret a variety of different JSON structures as
  Linked Data. A JSON-LD processor will make use of provided and embedded
  contexts to interpret property values in a number of different idiomatic
  ways.

One pattern in JSON is for the value of a property to be a string.
    Often times, this string actually represents some other typed value, for
    example an IRI , a date, or a string in some specific language. See § 4.2 Describing Values for details on how to
    describe such value typing.

In JSON, a property with an array value implies an implicit order;
    arrays in JSON-LD do not convey any ordering of the contained elements by
    default, unless defined using embedded structures or through a context
    definition. See § 4.3 Value Ordering for a
    further discussion.

Another JSON idiom often found in APIs is to use an
      intermediate object to group together related properties of an object; in JSON-LD
      these are referred to as nested properties and are described in § 4.4 Nested Properties .

Linked Data is all about describing the relationships between different resources.
      Sometimes these relationships are between resources defined in different
      documents described on the web, sometimes the resources are described
      within the same document.

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "knows": {"@type": "@id"} },
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny", "knows": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me" }

[{
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}], "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [{"@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"}] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny"; foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> .

In this case, a document residing at http://manu.sporny.org/about may contain the example above, and reference another document at https://greggkellogg.net/foaf which could include a similar
      representation.

A common idiom found in JSON usage is objects being specified as the
      value of other objects, called object embedding in JSON-LD;
      for example, a friend specified as an
      object value of a Person :

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny", "knows": { "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg" } }

[{
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}], "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [{
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}]
  }] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny"; foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> .
<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

See § 4.5 Embedding details these relationships.

Another common idiom in JSON is to use an intermediate object to represent property values via indexing. JSON-LD allows data to be indexed
    in a number of different ways, as detailed in § 4.6 Indexed Values .

JSON-LD serializes directed graphs . That means that
    every property points from a node to another node or value . However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction, as detailed in § 4.8 Reverse Properties .

The following sections describe such
  advanced functionality in more detail.


### 4.1 Advanced Context Usage

This section is non-normative.

Section § 3.1 The Context introduced the basics of what makes
  JSON-LD work. This section expands on the basic principles of the context and demonstrates how more advanced use cases can
  be achieved using JSON-LD.

In general, contexts may be used any time a map is defined.
    The only time that one cannot express a context is as a direct child of another context definition (other than as part of an expanded term definition ).
    For example, a JSON-LD document may
    have the form of an array composed of one or more node objects ,
    which use a context definition in each top-level node object :

[
  { "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld", "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
  }, { "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/place.jsonld", "name": "The Empire State Building",
    "description": "The Empire State Building is a 102-story landmark in New York City.",
    "geo": {
      "latitude": "40.75",
      "longitude": "73.98"
    }
  }
]

  ]
] .

The outer array is standard for a document in expanded document form and flattened document form ,
    and may be necessary when describing a disconnected graph,
    where nodes may not reference each other. In such cases, using
    a top-level map with a @graph property can be useful for saving
    the repetition of @context . See § 4.5 Embedding for more.

Duplicate context terms are overridden using a
    most-recently-defined-wins mechanism.

{ "@context": {
    "name": "http://example.com/person#name",
    "details": "http://example.com/person#details"
  } ,
  " name ": "Markus Lanthaler", ... "details": { "@context": {
      "name": "http://example.com/organization#name"
    } ,
    " name ": "Graz University of Technology"
  }
}

[{
  "http://example.com/person#details": [{
    "http://example.com/organization#name": [{
      "@value": "Graz University of Technology"
    }]
  }],
  "http://example.com/person#name": [{"@value": "Markus Lanthaler"}]
}]

@prefix person: <http://example.com/person#> .
@prefix org: <http://example.com/organization#> .

[
  person:name "Markus Lanthaler";
  person:details [org:name "Graz University of Technology"]
] .

In the example above, the name term is overridden
    in the more deeply nested details structure,
    which uses its own embedded context .
    Note that this is
    rarely a good authoring practice and is typically used when working with
    legacy applications that depend on a specific structure of the map . If a term is redefined within a
    context, all previous rules associated with the previous definition are
    removed. If a term is redefined to null ,
    the term is effectively removed from the list of terms defined in the active context .

Multiple contexts may be combined using an array , which is processed
    in order. The set of contexts defined within a specific map are
    referred to as local contexts . The active context refers to the accumulation of local contexts that are in scope at a
    specific point within the document. Setting a local context to null effectively resets the active context to an empty context, without term definitions , default language ,
    or other things defined within previous contexts.
    The following example specifies an external context
    and then layers an embedded context on top of the external context:

In JSON-LD 1.1, there are other mechanisms for introducing contexts, including
    scoped contexts and imported contexts, and there are new ways of protecting term definitions,
    so there are cases where the last defined inline context is not necessarily one
    which defines the scope of terms.
    See § 4.1.8 Scoped Contexts , § 4.1.9 Context Propagation , § 4.1.10 Imported Contexts , and § 4.1.11 Protected Term Definitions for further information.

] .

When possible, the context definition should be put
    at the top of a JSON-LD document. This makes the document easier to read and
    might make streaming parsers more efficient. Documents that do not have the context at the top are still conformant JSON-LD.

To avoid forward-compatibility issues, terms starting with an @ character followed exclusively by one or more ALPHA characters (see [ RFC5234 ]) are to be avoided as they
    might be used as keyword in future versions
    of JSON-LD. Terms starting with an @ character that are not JSON-LD 1.1 keywords are treated as any other term, i.e.,
    they are ignored unless mapped to an IRI . Furthermore, the use of
    empty terms ( "" ) is not allowed as
    not all programming languages are able to handle empty JSON keys.


#### 4.1.1 JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Mode

This section is non-normative.

New features defined in JSON-LD 1.1 are available
    unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 .
    This may be set through an API option.
    The processing mode may be explicitly set to json-ld-1.1 using the @version entry in a context set to the value 1.1 as a number , or through an API option.
    Explicitly setting the processing mode to json-ld-1.1 will prohibit JSON-LD 1.0 processors from incorrectly processing a JSON-LD 1.1 document.

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    ... } ,
  ... }

The first context encountered when processing a
    document which contains @version determines the processing mode ,
    unless it is defined explicitly through an API option.
    This means that if "@version": 1.1 is encountered after processing a context
    without @version ,
    the former will be interpreted as having had "@version": 1.1 defined within it.

Setting the processing mode explicitly
    to json-ld-1.1 is RECOMMENDED to prevent a JSON-LD 1.0 processor
    from incorrectly processing a JSON-LD 1.1 document and
    producing different results.


#### 4.1.2 Default Vocabulary

This section is non-normative.

At times, all properties and types may come from the same vocabulary. JSON-LD's @vocab keyword allows an author to set a common prefix which
    is used as the vocabulary mapping and is used
    for all properties and types that do not match a term and are neither
    an IRI nor a compact IRI (i.e., they do
    not contain a colon).

{
  "@context": { "@vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/" },
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": "Restaurant" , "name" : "Brew Eats" ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": ["http://example.com/vocab/Restaurant"],
  "http://example.com/vocab/name": [{"@value": "Brew Eats"}]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.com/vocab/> .

<http://example.org/places#BrewEats> a ex:Restaurant;
  ex:name "Brew Eats" .

If @vocab is used but certain keys in an map should not be expanded using
    the vocabulary IRI , a term can be explicitly set
    to null in the context . For instance, in the
    example below the databaseId entry would not expand to an IRI causing the property to be dropped when expanding.

{
  "@context": {
     "@vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/", "databaseId": null },
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": "Restaurant",
  "name": "Brew Eats", "databaseId" : "23987520"
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": ["http://example.com/vocab/Restaurant"],
  "http://example.com/vocab/name": [{"@value": "Brew Eats"}]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.com/vocab/> .

<http://example.org/places#BrewEats> a ex:Restaurant;
  ex:name "Brew Eats" .

Since JSON-LD 1.1,
    the vocabulary mapping in a local context can be set to a relative IRI reference ,
    which is concatenated to any vocabulary mapping in the active context (see § 4.1.4 Using the Document Base for the Default Vocabulary for how this applies if there is no vocabulary mapping in the active context ).

The following example illustrates the affect of expanding a property using
    a relative IRI reference , which is shown in the Expanded (Result) tab below.

{
  "@context": [{
    "@vocab": "http://example.com/" }, {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "vocab/"
  } ],
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": "Restaurant",
  "name": "Brew Eats" ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": ["http://example.com/vocab/Restaurant"],
  "http://example.com/vocab/name": [{"@value": "Brew Eats"}]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.com/vocab/> .

<http://example.org/places#BrewEats> a ex:Restaurant;
  ex:name "Brew Eats" .

The grammar for @vocab , as defined in § 9.15 Context Definitions allows the value to be a term or compact IRI .
    Note that terms used in the value of @vocab must be in scope at the time the context is introduced,
    otherwise there would be a circular dependency between @vocab and other terms defined in the same context.


#### 4.1.3 Base IRI

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD allows IRIs to be specified in a relative form which is
    resolved against the document base according section 5.1 Establishing a Base URI of [ RFC3986 ]. The base IRI may be explicitly set with a context using the @base keyword.

For example, if a JSON-LD document was retrieved from http://example.com/document.jsonld , relative IRI references would resolve against that IRI :

{
  "@context": {
    "label": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"
  }, "@id": "" ,
  "label": "Just a simple document"
}

This document uses an empty @id , which resolves to the document base.
    However, if the document is moved to a different location, the IRI would change.
    To prevent this without having to use an IRI , a context may define an @base mapping, to overwrite the base IRI for the document.

{
  "@context": { "@base": "http://example.com/document.jsonld", "label": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"
  },
  "@id": "",
  "label": "Just a simple document"
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/document.jsonld",
  "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{"@value": "Just a simple document"}]
}]

@base <http://example.com/document.jsonld> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<> rdfs:label "Just a simple document" .

Setting @base to null will prevent relative IRI references from being expanded to IRIs .

Please note that the @base will be ignored if used in
    external contexts.


#### 4.1.4 Using the Document Base for the Default Vocabulary

This section is non-normative.

In some cases, vocabulary terms are defined directly within the document
    itself, rather than in an external vocabulary.
    Since JSON-LD 1.1, the vocabulary mapping in a local context can be set to a relative IRI reference ,
    which is, if there is no vocabulary mapping in scope, resolved against the base IRI .
    This causes terms which are expanded relative to the vocabulary,
    such as the keys of node objects ,
    to be based on the base IRI to create IRIs .

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1, "@base": "http://example/document", "@vocab": "#" },
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": "Restaurant" , "name" : "Brew Eats" ... }

If this document were located at http://example/document , it would expand as follows:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": ["http://example/document#Restaurant"],
  "http://example/document#name": [{"@value": "Brew Eats"}]
}]

<http://example.org/places#BrewEats> a <http://example/document#Restaurant>;
  <http://example/document#name> "Brew Eats" .


#### 4.1.5 Compact IRIs

This section is non-normative.

A compact IRI is a way of expressing an IRI using a prefix and suffix separated by a colon ( : ).
    The prefix is a term taken from the active context and is a short string identifying a
    particular IRI in a JSON-LD document. For example, the
    prefix foaf may be used as a shorthand for the
    Friend-of-a-Friend vocabulary, which is identified using the IRI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ . A developer may append
    any of the FOAF vocabulary terms to the end of the prefix to specify a short-hand
    version of the IRI for the vocabulary term. For example, foaf:name would be expanded to the IRI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name .

{
  " @context ": {
    " foaf ": " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " ... },
  "@type": " foaf:Person ",
  " foaf:name ": "Dave Longley" ,
  ... }

[{
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Dave Longley"}]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   a foaf:Person;
   foaf:name "Dave Longley"
 ] .

In the example above, foaf:name expands to the IRI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name and foaf:Person expands
    to http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person .

Prefixes are expanded when the form of the value
    is a compact IRI represented as a prefix:suffix combination, the prefix matches a term defined within the active context , and the suffix does not begin with two
    slashes ( // ). The compact IRI is expanded by
    concatenating the IRI mapped to the prefix to the (possibly empty) suffix . If the prefix is not defined in the active context ,
    or the suffix begins with two slashes (such as in http://example.com ),
    the value is interpreted as IRI instead. If the prefix is an
    underscore ( _ ), the value is interpreted as blank node identifier instead.

It's also possible to use compact IRIs within the context as shown in the
    following example:

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#", "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" , "foaf:homepage" : { "@type": "@id" },
    "picture": { "@id": "foaf:depiction" , "@type": "@id" }
  },
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "@type": "foaf:Person",
  "foaf:name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "foaf:homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "picture": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler"
}

[{
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{
    "@value": "Markus Lanthaler"
  }],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [{
    "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
  }],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/depiction": [{
    "@id": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler"
  }]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Markus Lanthaler";
  foaf:homepage <http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/>;
  foaf:depiction <http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler> .

When operating explicitly with the processing mode for JSON-LD 1.0 compatibility, terms may be chosen as compact IRI prefixes when
    compacting only if a simple term definition is used where the value ends with a
    URI gen-delim character (e.g, / , # and others, see [ RFC3986 ]).

In JSON-LD 1.1, terms may be chosen as compact IRI prefixes
    when expanding or compacting only if
    a simple term definition is used where the value ends with a URI gen-delim character,
    or if their expanded term definition contains
    a @prefix entry with the value true .
    If a simple term definition does not end with a URI gen-delim character,
    or a expanded term definition contains
    a @prefix entry with the value false ,
    the term will not be used for either expanding compact IRIs or compacting IRIs to compact IRIs .

The term selection behavior for 1.0 processors was changed
    as a result of an errata against JSON-LD 1.0 reported here .
    This does not affect the behavior of processing existing JSON-LD documents, but creates
    a slight change when compacting documents using Compact IRIs .

The behavior when compacting can be illustrated by considering the following input
    document in expanded form:

[{
  "http://example.com/vocab/property": [{"@value": "property"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab/propertyOne": [{"@value": "propertyOne"}]
}]

Using the following context in the 1.0 processing mode will now select the term vocab rather than property , even though the IRI associated with property captures more of the original IRI .

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "property": "http://example.com/vocab/property"
  }
}

Compacting using the previous context with the above expanded input document
    results in the following compacted result:

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "property": "http://example.com/vocab/property"
  },
  "property": "property", "vocab:propertyOne" : "propertyOne"
}

@prefix vocab: <http://example.com/vocab/> .

[ vocab:property "property"; vocab:propertyOne "propertyOne"] .

In the original [ JSON-LD10 ],
    the term selection algorithm would have selected property ,
    creating the Compact IRI property:One .
    The original behavior can be made explicit using @prefix :

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1, "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "property": {
      "@id": "http://example.com/vocab/property", "@prefix": true }
  }
}

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1, "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "property": {
      "@id": "http://example.com/vocab/property", "@prefix": true }
  },
  "property": "property", "property:One" : "propertyOne"
}

@prefix vocab: <http://example.com/vocab/> .

[ vocab:property "property"; vocab:propertyOne "propertyOne"] .

In this case, the property term would not normally be usable as a prefix, both
    because it is defined with an expanded term definition , and because
    its @id does not end in a gen-delim character. Adding "@prefix": true allows it to be used as the prefix portion of
    the compact IRI property:One .


#### 4.1.6 Aliasing Keywords

This section is non-normative.

Each of the JSON-LD keywords ,
    except for @context , may be aliased to application-specific
    keywords. This feature allows legacy JSON content to be utilized
    by JSON-LD by re-using JSON keys that already exist in legacy documents.
    This feature also allows developers to design domain-specific implementations
    using only the JSON-LD context .

{
  "@context": { "url": "@id" , "a": "@type" ,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
  },
  " url ": "http://example.com/about#gregg",
  " a ": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
  "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
}

[{ "@type ": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}],
  " @id ": "http://example.com/about#gregg"
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.com/about#gregg> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

In the example above, the @id and @type keywords have been given the aliases url and a , respectively.

Other than for @type , properties of expanded term definitions where the term is a keyword result in an error. Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 ,
      there is also an exception for @type ;
      see § 4.3.3 Using @set with @type for further details
      and usage examples.

Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 ,
    aliases of keywords are either simple term definitions ,
    where the value is a keyword ,
    or a expanded term definitions with an @id entry and optionally an @protected entry ;
    no other entries are allowed.
    There is also an exception for aliases of @type ,
    as indicated above.
    See § 4.1.11 Protected Term Definitions for further details
    of using @protected .

Since keywords cannot be redefined, they can also not be aliased to
    other keywords.

Aliased keywords may not be used within a context , itself.

See § 9.16 Keywords for a normative
    definition of all keywords.


#### 4.1.7 IRI Expansion within a Context

This section is non-normative.

In general, normal IRI expansion rules apply
    anywhere an IRI is expected (see § 3.2 IRIs ). Within
    a context definition, this can mean that terms defined
    within the context may also be used within that context as long as
    there are no circular dependencies. For example, it is common to use
    the xsd namespace when defining typed values :

{
  "@context": { "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#" ,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer" },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  } ,
  ... }

In this example, the xsd term is defined
  and used as a prefix for the @type coercion
  of the age property.

Terms may also be used when defining the IRI of another term :

{
  "@context": { "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" ,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name" ,
    "age": {
      "@id": "foaf:age" ,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "foaf:homepage" ,
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  } ,
  ... }

Compact IRIs and IRIs may be used on the left-hand side of a term definition.

{
  "@context": { "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" ,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    " foaf:age ": {
      "@id": " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age ",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    " foaf:homepage ": {
      "@type": "@id"
    } } ,
  ... }

In this example, the compact IRI form is used in two different ways.
  In the first approach, foaf:age declares both the IRI for the term (using short-form) as well as the @type associated with the term . In the second
  approach, only the @type associated with the term is
  specified. The full IRI for foaf:homepage is determined by looking up the foaf prefix in the context .

If a compact IRI is used as a term , it must expand to the
  value that compact IRI would have on its own when expanded.
  This represents a change to the original 1.0 algorithm to prevent terms from
  expanding to a different IRI , which could lead to undesired results.

{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "foaf:age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "foaf:homepage": { "@id": "http://schema.org/url" ,
     "@type": "@id"
    }
  } ,
  ... }

IRIs may also be used in the key position in a context :

{
  "@context": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "foaf:age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage ": {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  } ,
  ... }

In order for the IRI to match above, the IRI needs to be used in the JSON-LD document . Also note that foaf:homepage will not use the { "@type": "@id" } declaration because foaf:homepage is not the same as http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage .
  That is, terms are looked up in a context using
  direct string comparison before the prefix lookup mechanism is applied.

Neither an IRI reference nor a compact IRI may expand to some other unrelated IRI .
  This represents a change to the original 1.0 algorithm which allowed this behavior but discouraged it.

The only other exception for using terms in the context is that
  circular definitions are not allowed. That is,
  a definition of term1 cannot depend on the
  definition of term2 if term2 also depends on term1 . For example, the following context definition
  is illegal:

{
  "@context": { "term1": "term2:foo",
    "term2": "term1:bar" } ,
  ... }


#### 4.1.8 Scoped Contexts

This section is non-normative.

An expanded term definition can include a @context property, which defines a context (a scoped context ) for values of properties defined using that term .
    When used for a property , this is called a property-scoped context .
    This allows values to use term definitions , the base IRI , vocabulary mappings or the default language which are different from the node object they are contained in, as if the context was specified within the value itself.

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "name": "http://schema.org/name",
    "interest": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/interest", "@context": {"@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"} }
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "interest": {
    "@id": "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/",
    "name": "JSON-LD",
    "topic": "Linking Data"
  } }

[{
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/interest": [
    {
      "@id": "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/",
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "JSON-LD"}],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/topic": [{"@value": "Linking Data"}]
    }
  ],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

[
  schema:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:interest <https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/>
] .
<https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/> schema:name "JSON-LD";
  foaf:topic "Linking Data" .

In this case, the social profile is defined using the schema.org vocabulary,
    but interest is imported from FOAF,
    and is used to define a node describing one of Manu's interests
    where those properties now come from the FOAF vocabulary.

Expanding this document, uses a combination of terms defined in the outer context,
    and those defined specifically for that term in a property-scoped context .

Scoping can also be performed using a term used as a value of @type :

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "name": "http://schema.org/name",
    "interest": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/interest",
    "Person": "http://schema.org/Person", "Document" : {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Document", "@context": {"@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"} }
  },
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "interest": {
    "@id": "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/", "@type": "Document" ,
    "name": "JSON-LD",
    "topic": "Linking Data"
  }
}

[{
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/interest": [
    {
      "@id": "https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/",
      "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Document"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "JSON-LD"}],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/topic": [{"@value": "Linking Data"}]
    }
  ],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

[
  a schema:Person;
  schema:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:interest <https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/>
] .
<https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/> a foaf:Document;
  schema:name "JSON-LD";
  foaf:topic "Linking Data" .

Scoping on @type is useful when common properties are used to
    relate things of different types, where the vocabularies in use within
    different entities calls for different context scoping. For example, hasPart / partOf may be common terms used in a document, but mean
    different things depending on the context.
    A type-scoped context is only in effect for the node object on which
    the type is used; the previous in-scope contexts are placed back into
    effect when traversing into another node object .
    As described further in § 4.1.9 Context Propagation ,
    this may be controlled using the @propagate keyword.

Any property-scoped or local contexts that were introduced in the node object would still be in effect when traversing into another node object .

When expanding, each value of @type is considered
    (ordering them lexicographically) where that value is also a term in
    the active context having its own type-scoped context .
    If so, that the scoped context is applied to the active context .

The values of @type are unordered, so if multiple
    types are listed, the order that type-scoped contexts are applied is based on
    lexicographical ordering.

For example, consider the following semantically equivalent examples.
    The first example, shows how properties and types can define their own
    scoped contexts, which are included when expanding.

{ "@context" : { "@version" : 1.1 , "@vocab" : "http://example.com/vocab/" , "property" : { "@id" : "http://example.com/vocab/property" , "@context" : { "term1" : "http://example.com/vocab/term1" ↑ Scoped context for "property" defines term1 }
    }, "Type1" : { "@id" : "http://example.com/vocab/Type1" , "@context" : { "term3" : "http://example.com/vocab/term3" ↑ Scoped context for "Type1" defines term3 }
    }, "Type2" : { "@id" : "http://example.com/vocab/Type2" , "@context" : { "term4" : "http://example.com/vocab/term4" ↑ Scoped context for "Type2" defines term4 }
    }
  }, "property" : { "@context" : { "term2" : "http://example.com/vocab/term2" ↑ Embedded context defines term2 }, "@type" : [ "Type2" , "Type1" ], "term1" : "a" , "term2" : "b" , "term3" : "c" , "term4" : "d" }
}

Contexts are processed depending on how they are defined.
    A property-scoped context is processed first,
    followed by any embedded context ,
    followed lastly by the type-scoped contexts ,
    in the appropriate order. The previous example is logically equivalent to the following:

{ "@context" : { "@vocab" : "http://example.com/vocab/" , "property" : "http://example.com/vocab/property" , "Type1" : "http://example.com/vocab/Type1" , "Type2" : "http://example.com/vocab/Type2" }, "property" : { "@context" : [{ "term1" : "http://example.com/vocab/term1" ↑ Previously scoped context for "property" defines term1 }, { "term2" : "http://example.com/vocab/term2" ↑ Embedded context defines term2 }, { "term3" : "http://example.com/vocab/term3" ↑ Previously scoped context for "Type1" defines term3 }, { "term4" : "http://example.com/vocab/term4" ↑ Previously scoped context for "Type2" defines term4 }], "@type" : [ "Type2" , "Type1" ], "term1" : "a" , "term2" : "b" , "term3" : "c" , "term4" : "d" }
}

If a term defines a scoped context ,
    and then that term is later redefined,
    the association of the context defined in the earlier expanded term definition is lost
    within the scope of that redefinition. This is consistent with term definitions of a term overriding previous term definitions from
    earlier less deeply nested definitions, as discussed in § 4.1 Advanced Context Usage .

Scoped Contexts are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


#### 4.1.9 Context Propagation

This section is non-normative.

Once introduced, contexts remain in effect until a subsequent context removes it by setting @context to null ,
    or by redefining terms,
    with the exception of type-scoped contexts ,
    which limit the effect of that context until the next node object is entered.
    This behavior can be changed using the @propagate keyword.

The following example illustrates how terms defined in a context with @propagate set to false are effectively removed when descending into new node object .

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "term": {
      "@id": "http://example.org/original",
      "@context": {
        "@propagate": false, ↑ Scoped context only lasts in one node-object "term": "http://example.org/non-propagated-term"
      }
    }
  },
  "term": { ↑ This term is the original "term": { ↑ This term is from the scoped context "term": "This term is from the first context" ↑ This term is the original again }
  }
}

[{
  "http://example.org/original": [{
    "http://example.org/non-propagated-term": [{
      "http://example.org/original": [
        {"@value": "This term is from the first context"}
      ]
    }]
  }]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
[
  ex:original [
    ex:non-propagated-term [
      ex:original "This term is from the first context"
    ]
  ]
] .

Contexts included within an array must all have the same value for @propagate due to the way that rollback is defined in JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API .


#### 4.1.10 Imported Contexts

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD 1.0 included mechanisms for modifying the context that
    is in effect. This included the capability to load and process a remote context and then apply further changes to it via new contexts .

However, with the introduction of JSON-LD 1.1, it is also desirable to
    be able to load a remote context , in particular an existing JSON-LD
    1.0 context , and apply JSON-LD 1.1 features to it prior to
    processing.

By using the @import keyword in a context , another remote context , referred to as an imported context , can be loaded and
    modified prior to processing. The modifications are expressed in the context that includes the @import keyword, referred to as the
    wrapping context . Once an imported context is loaded, the
    contents of the wrapping context are merged into it prior to
    processing. The merge operation will cause each key-value pair in the
    wrapping context to be added to the loaded imported context ,
    with the wrapping context key-value pairs taking precedence.

By enabling existing contexts to be reused and edited inline prior
    to processing, context-wide keywords can be applied to adjust all term
    definitions in the imported context . Similarly, term definitions can
    be replaced prior to processing, enabling adjustments that, for instance, ensure term
    definitions match previously protected terms or that they include
    additional type coercion information.

The following examples illustrate how @import can be used to express
    a type-scoped context that loads an imported context and
    sets @propagate to true , as a technique for making other similar modifications.

Suppose there was a context that could be referenced remotely
    via the URL https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld :

{
  "@context": {
    "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
    "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
    "term1": "http://example.com/vocab#term1",
    "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2" ,
    ... }
}

A wrapping context could be used to source it and modify it:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "MyType": {
      "@id": "http://example.com/vocab#MyType",
      "@context": {
        "@version": 1.1,
        "@import": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld",
        "@propagate": true
      }
    }
  }
}

The effect would be the same as if the entire imported context had been copied into the type-scoped context :

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "MyType": {
      "@id": "http://example.com/vocab#MyType",
      "@context": {
        "@version": 1.1,
        "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
        "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
        "term1": "http://example.com/vocab#term1",
        "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2", ... "@propagate": true
      }
    }
  }
}

Similarly, the wrapping context may replace term definitions or
    set other context-wide keywords that may affect how the imported context term definitions will be processed:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@import": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/remote-context.jsonld",
    "@vocab": "http://example.org/vocab#", ↑ This will replace any previous @vocab definition prior to processing it "term1": {
      "@id": "http://example.org/vocab#term1",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
    } ↑ This will replace the old term1 definition prior to processing it }
}

Again, the effect would be the same as if the entire imported context had been copied into the context :

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "Type1": "http://example.com/vocab/Type1",
    "Type2": "http://example.com/vocab/Type2",
    "term1": {
      "@id": "http://example.org/vocab#term1",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
    }, ↑ Note term1 has been replaced prior to processing "term2": "http://example.com/vocab#term2", ..., "@vocab": "http://example.org/vocab#"
  }
}

The result of loading imported contexts must be context definition , not an IRI or an array .
    Additionally, the imported context cannot include an @import entry .


#### 4.1.11 Protected Term Definitions

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD is used in many specifications as the specified data format.
    However, there is also a desire to allow some JSON-LD contents to be processed as plain JSON,
    without using any of the JSON-LD algorithms.
    Because JSON-LD is very flexible,
    some terms from the original format may be locally overridden
    through the use of embedded contexts ,
    and take a different meaning for JSON-LD based implementations.
    On the other hand, "plain JSON" implementations may not be able to interpret these embedded contexts ,
    and hence will still interpret those terms with their original meaning.
    To prevent this divergence of interpretation,
    JSON-LD 1.1 allows term definitions to be protected .

A protected term definition is a term definition with an entry @protected set to true .
    It generally prevents further contexts from overriding this term definition,
    either through a new definition of the same term,
    or through clearing the context with "@context": null .
    Such attempts will raise an error and abort the processing
    (except in some specific situations described below ).

{
  "@context": [
    { "@version": 1.1 ,
      "Person": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
      "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows",
      "name": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name", "@protected": true }
    },
    { – this attempt will fail with an error "name": "http://schema.org/name" }
  ],
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "knows": {
    "@context": [ – this attempt would also fail with an error null, "http://schema.org/"
    ],
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
  }
}

When all or most term definitions of a context need to be protected,
    it is possible to add an entry @protected set to true to the context itself.
    It has the same effect as protecting each of its term definitions individually.
    Exceptions can be made by adding an entry @protected set to false in some term definitions.

{
  "@context": [
    { "@version": 1.1 , "@protected": true ,
      "name": "http://schema.org/name",
      "member": "http://schema.org/member",
      "Person": {
        "@id": "http://schema.org/Person", "@protected": false }
    }
  ],
  "name": "Digital Bazaar",
  "member": {
    "@context": { ­– name *is* protected, so the following would fail with an error
      –   "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
      ­– Person is *not* protected, and can be overridden "Person": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"
    },
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Manu Sporny"
  }
}

[{
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Digital Bazaar"}],
  "http://schema.org/member": [
    {
      "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

[
  schema:name "Digital Bazaar";
  schema:member [
    a foaf:Person;
    schema:name "Manu Sporny"
  ]
] .

While protected terms can in general not be overridden,
    there are two exceptions to this rule.
    The first exception is that a context is allowed to redefine a protected term
    if the new definition is identical to the protected term definition
    (modulo the @protected flag).
    The rationale is that the new definition does not violate the protection,
    as it does not change the semantics of the protected term.
    This is useful for widespread term definitions,
    such as aliasing @type to type ,
    which may occur (including in a protected form) in several contexts.

{
  "@context": [
    {
      "@version": 1.1,
      "@protected": true, "id": "@id",
      "type": "@type" ,
      "Organization": "http://example.org/orga/Organization",
      "member": {
        "@id": "http://example.org/orga/member",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    },
    { "id": "@id",
      "type": "@type", ­– Those "redefinitions" do not raise an error.
      ­– Note however that the terms are still protected "Person": "http://schema.org/Person",
      "name": "http://schema.org/name"
    }
  ],
  "id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/",
  "type": "Organization",
  "member" : {
    "id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "type": "Person",
    "name": "Manu Sporny"
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/",
  "@type": ["http://example.org/orga/Organization"],
  "http://example.org/orga/member": [
    {
      "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
      "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix o: <http://example.org/orga/>.
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.

<https://digitalbazaar.com/> a o:Organization ;
  o:member <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu>.

<http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a schema:Person ;
  schema:name "Manu Sporny".

The second exception is that a property-scoped context is not affected by protection, and can therefore override protected terms,
    either with a new term definition,
    or by clearing the context with "@context": null .

The rationale is that "plain JSON" implementations,
    relying on a given specification,
    will only traverse properties defined by that specification. Scoped contexts belonging to the specified properties are part of the specification,
    so the "plain JSON" implementations are expected to be aware of the change of semantics they induce. Scoped contexts belonging to other properties apply to parts of the document that "plain JSON" implementations will ignore.
    In both cases, there is therefore no risk of diverging interpretations between JSON-LD-aware implementations and "plain JSON" implementations,
    so overriding is permitted.

{
  "@context": [
    { – This context reflects the specification used by "plain JSON" implementations "@version": 1.1 , "@protected": true ,
      "Organization": "http://schema.org/Organization",
      "name": "http://schema.org/name",
      "employee": {
        "@id": "http://schema.org/employee", "@context": {
          "@protected": true,
          "name": "http://schema.org/familyName"
        } ↑ overrides the definition of "name" }
    },
    { – This context extends the previous one,
      – only JSON-LD-aware implementations are expected to use it "location": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/based_near",
        "@context": [ null, ↑ clears the context entirely, including all protected terms { "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Digital Bazaar",
  "employee" : {
    "name": "Sporny",
    "location": {"name": "Blacksburg, Virginia"}
  }
}

[{
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/Organization"],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Digital Bazaar"}],
  "http://schema.org/employee": [
    {
      "http://schema.org/familyName": [{"@value": "Sporny"}],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/based_near": [
        {
          "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Blacksburg, Virginia"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.

[
  a schema:Organization;
  schema:name "Digital Bazaar";
  schema:employee [
    schema:familyName "Sporny";
    foaf:based_near [
      foaf:name "Blacksburg, Virginia"
    ];
  ];
] .

By preventing terms from being overridden,
    protection also prevents any adaptation of a term
    (e.g., defining a more precise datatype, restricting the term's use to lists, etc.).
    This kind of adaptation is frequent with some general purpose contexts,
    for which protection would therefore hinder their usability.
    As a consequence, context publishers should use this feature with care.

Protected term definitions are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


### 4.2 Describing Values

This section is non-normative.

Values are leaf nodes in a graph associated with scalar values such as strings , dates, times, and other such atomic values.


#### 4.2.1 Typed Values

This section is non-normative.

A value with an associated type, also known as a typed value , is indicated by associating a value with
  an IRI which indicates the value's type. Typed values may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in three ways:

By utilizing the @type keyword when defining
    a term within an @context section.

By utilizing a value object .

By using a native JSON type such as number , true , or false .

The first example uses the @type keyword to associate a
  type with a particular term in the @context :

{ "@context": {
    "modified": {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
    }
  }, ... "@id": "http://example.com/docs/1",
  "modified": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00" ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/docs/1",
  "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified": [
    {
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime",
      "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00"
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://example.com/docs/1> dcterms:modified "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime .

The modified key's value above is automatically interpreted as a dateTime value because of the information specified in the @context . The example tabs show how a JSON-LD processor will interpret the data.

The second example uses the expanded form of setting the type information
  in the body of a JSON-LD document:

{
  "@context": {
    "modified": {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified"
    }
  }, ... "modified": {
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
    "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
  } ... }

[{
  "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified": [
    {
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime",
      "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00"
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

[ dcterms:modified "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime ] .

Both examples above would generate the value 2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00 with the type http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime . Note that it is
  also possible to use a term or a compact IRI to
  express the value of a type.

The @type keyword is also used to associate a type
  with a node .
  The concept of a node type and a value type are distinct.
  For more on adding types to nodes , see § 3.5 Specifying the Type .

When expanding, an @type defined within a term definition can be associated with a string value to create an expanded value object ,
  which is described in § 4.2.3 Type Coercion .
  Type coercion only takes place on string values, not for values which are maps ,
  such as node objects and value objects in their expanded form.

A node type specifies the type of thing
  that is being described, like a person, place, event, or web page. A value type specifies the data type of a particular value, such
  as an integer, a floating point number, or a date.

{ ... "@id": "http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia", "@type": "http://schema.org/BlogPosting" , ← This is a node type "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified": {
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime" ← This is a value type } ... }

The first use of @type associates a node type ( http://schema.org/BlogPosting ) with the node ,
  which is expressed using the @id keyword .
  The second use of @type associates a value type ( http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime ) with the
  value expressed using the @value keyword . As a
  general rule, when @value and @type are used in
  the same map , the @type keyword is expressing a value type .
  Otherwise, the @type keyword is expressing a node type . The example above expresses the following data:

@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia> a schema:BlogPosting ;
  dcterms:modified "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00"^^ xsd:dateTime .


#### 4.2.2 JSON Literals

This section is non-normative.

At times, it is useful to include JSON within JSON-LD that is not interpreted as JSON-LD.
    Generally, a JSON-LD processor will ignore properties which don't map to IRIs ,
    but this causes them to be excluded when performing various algorithmic transformations.
    But, when the data that is being described is, itself, JSON, it's important that
    it survives algorithmic transformations.

JSON-LD is intended to allow native JSON to be
    interpreted through the use of a context .
    The use of JSON literals creates blobs of data which are not available for interpretation.
    It is for use only in the rare cases that JSON cannot be represented as JSON-LD.

When a term is defined with @type set to @json ,
    a JSON-LD processor will treat the value as a JSON literal ,
    rather than interpreting it further as JSON-LD.
    In the expanded document form , such JSON will become the value of @value within a value object having "@type": "@json" .

When transformed into RDF, the JSON literal will have a lexical form based on
    a specific serialization of the JSON,
    as described in Compaction algorithm of [ JSON-LD11-API ]
    and the JSON datatype .

The following example shows an example of a JSON Literal contained as the
    value of a property. Note that the RDF results use a canonicalized form of the JSON
    to ensure interoperability between different processors.
    JSON canonicalization is described in Data Round Tripping in [ JSON-LD11-API ].

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "e": {"@id": "http://example.com/vocab/json", "@type": "@json" }
  },
  "e": [
    56.0,
    {
      "d": true,
      "10": null,
      "1": [ ]
    }
  ] }

[{
  "http://example.com/vocab/json": [{
    "@value": [
      56.0,
      {
        "d": true,
        "10": null,
        "1": []
      }
    ],
    "@type": "@json"
  }]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.com/vocab/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
[ex:json """[56,{"1":[],"10":null,"d":true}]"""^^rdf:JSON ] .

Generally, when a JSON-LD processor encounters null ,
  the associated entry or value is removed.
  However, null is a valid JSON token; when used as the value
  of a JSON literal , a null value will be preserved.


#### 4.2.3 Type Coercion

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD supports the coercion of string values to particular data types.
Type coercion allows someone deploying JSON-LD to use string property values
and have those values be interpreted as typed values by associating an IRI with the value in the expanded value object representation.
Using type coercion, string value representation can be used without requiring
the data type to be specified explicitly with each piece of data.

Type coercion is specified within an expanded term definition using the @type key. The value of this key expands to an IRI .
  Alternatively, the keyword @id or @vocab may be used
  as value to indicate that within the body of a JSON-LD document, a string value of a term coerced to @id or @vocab is to be interpreted as an IRI . The difference between @id and @vocab is how values are expanded
  to IRIs . @vocab first tries to expand the value
  by interpreting it as term . If no matching term is found in the active context , it tries to expand it as an IRI or a compact IRI if there's a colon in the value; otherwise, it will expand the value using the active context's vocabulary mapping , if present.
  Values coerced to @id in contrast are expanded as
  an IRI or a compact IRI if a colon is present; otherwise, they are interpreted
  as relative IRI references .

The ability to coerce a value using a term definition is distinct
  from setting one or more types on a node object , as the former does not result in
  new data being added to the graph, while the latter manages node types
  through adding additional relationships to the graph.

Terms or compact IRIs used as the value of a @type key may be defined within the same context. This means that one may specify a term like xsd and then use xsd:integer within the same
  context definition.

The example below demonstrates how a JSON-LD author can coerce values to typed values and IRIs .

{
  "@context": {
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    } ,
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    } },
  "@id": "http://example.com/people#john",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": "41" ,
  "homepage": [
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ] }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/people#john",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "John Smith"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age": [{
    "@value": "41",
    "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"
  }] ,
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [{
    "@id": "http://personal.example.org/"
  }, {
    "@id": "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  }] }]

@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.com/people#john> foaf:name "John Smith";
  foaf:age 41 ;
  foaf:homepage <http://personal.example.org/>,
    <http://work.example.com/jsmith/> .

It is important to note that terms are only used in expansion
  for vocabulary-relative positions, such as for keys and values of map entries .
  Values of @id are considered to be document-relative,
  and do not use term definitions for expansion. For example, consider the following:

{
  "@context": {
    "@base": "http://example1.com/",
    "@vocab": "http://example2.com/",
    "knows": {"@type": "@vocab"}
  },
  "@id": "fred",
  "knows": [
    {"@id": "barney", "mnemonic": "the sidekick"},
    "barney"
  ]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example1.com/fred",
  "http://example2.com/knows": [{
    "@id": "http://example1.com/barney",
    "http://example2.com/mnemonic": [{"@value": "the sidekick"}]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example2.com/barney"
  }]
}]

@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix ex1: <http://example1.com/> .
@prefix ex2: <http://example2.com/> .

ex1:barney ex2:mnemonic "the sidekick" .

ex1:fred ex2:knows ex1:barney, ex2:barney .

The unexpected result is that "barney" expands to both http://example1.com/barney and http://example2.com/barney , depending where it is encountered.
  String values interpreted as IRIs because of the associated term definitions are typically considered to be document-relative.
  In some cases, it makes sense to interpret these relative to the vocabulary,
  prescribed using "@type": "@vocab" in the term definition , though this can
  lead to unexpected consequences such as these.

In the previous example, "barney" appears twice, once as the value of @id ,
  which is always interpreted as a document-relative IRI , and once as the value of
  "fred", which is defined to be vocabulary-relative, thus the different expanded values.

For more on this see § 4.1.2 Default Vocabulary .

A variation on the previous example using "@type": "@id" instead
  of @vocab illustrates the behavior of interpreting "barney" relative to the document:

{
  "@context": {
    "@base": "http://example1.com/",
    "@vocab": "http://example2.com/",
    "knows": {"@type": "@id"}
  },
  "@id": "fred",
  "knows": [
    {"@id": "barney", "mnemonic": "the sidekick"},
    "barney"
  ]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example1.com/fred",
  "http://example2.com/knows": [{
    "@id": "http://example1.com/barney",
    "http://example2.com/mnemonic": [{"@value": "the sidekick"}]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example1.com/barney"
  }]
}]

@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix ex1: <http://example1.com/> .
@prefix ex2: <http://example2.com/> .

ex1:barney ex2:mnemonic "the sidekick" .

ex1:fred ex2:knows ex1:barney, ex1:barney .

The triple ex1:fred ex2:knows ex1:barney . is emitted twice,
  but exists only once in an output dataset, as it is a duplicate triple.

Terms may also be defined using IRIs or compact IRIs . This allows coercion rules
  to be applied to keys which are not represented as a simple term .
  For example:

{
  "@context": {
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    " foaf:age ": { "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age" ,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage ": {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  "foaf:name": "John Smith",
  " foaf:age ": "41",
  " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage ": [
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ]
}

[{
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age": [{"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer", "@value": "41"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "John Smith"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
    {"@id": "http://personal.example.org/"},
    {"@id": "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"}
  ]
}
]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

 [
   foaf:age 41;
   foaf:homepage <http://personal.example.org/>,
     <http://work.example.com/jsmith/>;
   foaf:name "John Smith"
] .

In this case the @id definition in the term definition is optional.
  If it does exist, the IRI or compact IRI representing
  the term will always be expanded to IRI defined by the @id key—regardless of whether a prefix is defined or not.

Type coercion is always performed using the unexpanded value of the key. In the
  example above, that means that type coercion is done looking for foaf:age in the active context and not for the corresponding, expanded IRI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age .

Keys in the context are treated as terms for the purpose of
  expansion and value coercion. At times, this may result in multiple representations for the same expanded IRI .
  For example, one could specify that dog and cat both expanded to http://example.com/vocab#animal .
  Doing this could be useful for establishing different type coercion or language specification rules.


#### 4.2.4 String Internationalization

This section is non-normative.

At times, it is important to annotate a string with its language. In JSON-LD this is possible in a variety of ways.
    First, it is possible to define a default language for a JSON-LD document
    by setting the @language key in the context :

{ "@context": {
    "name": "http://example.org/name",
    "occupation": "http://example.org/occupation", ... "@language": "ja"
  } ,
  "name": "花澄" ,
  "occupation": "科学者" }

[{
  "http://example.org/name": [{"@value": "花澄" , "@language": "ja"}],
  "http://example.org/occupation": [{"@value": "科学者" , "@language": "ja"}]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

[
  ex:name "花澄" @ja;
  ex:occupation "科学者" @ja
] .

The example above would associate the ja language
    tag with the two strings 花澄 and 科学者 Languages tags are defined in [ BCP47 ].
    The default language applies to all string values that are not type coerced .

To clear the default language for a subtree, @language can
    be set to null in an intervening context, such as a scoped context as follows:

{
  "@context": { ... "@version": 1.1, "@vocab": "http://example.com/",
    "@language": "ja",
    "details": { "@context": {
        "@language": null
      } }
  },
  "name": "花澄",
  "details": {"occupation": "Ninja"}
}

Second, it is possible to associate a language with a specific term using an expanded term definition :

{
  "@context": { ... "ex": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "@language": "ja",
    "name": { "@id": "ex:name", "@language": null },
    "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation" },
    "occupation_en": { "@id": "ex:occupation", "@language": "en" },
    "occupation_cs": { "@id": "ex:occupation", "@language": "cs" }
  }, "name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
  "occupation": "忍者",
  "occupation_en": "Ninja",
  "occupation_cs": "Nindža" ,
  ... }

The example above would associate 忍者 with the specified default
    language tag ja , Ninja with the language tag en , and Nindža with the language tag cs .
    The value of name , Yagyū Muneyoshi wouldn't be
    associated with any language tag since @language was reset to null in the expanded term definition .

Language associations are only applied to plain strings . Typed values or values that are subject to type coercion are not language tagged.

Just as in the example above, systems often need to express the value of a
    property in multiple languages. Typically, such systems also try to ensure that
    developers have a programmatically easy way to navigate the data structures for
    the language-specific data. In this case, language maps may be utilized.

{
  "@context": { ... "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation", "@container": "@language" }
  },
  "name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
  "occupation": {
    "ja": "忍者",
    "en": "Ninja",
    "cs": "Nindža"
  } ... }

The example above expresses exactly the same information as the previous
    example but consolidates all values in a single property. To access the
    value in a specific language in a programming language supporting dot-notation
    accessors for object properties, a developer may use the property.language pattern
    (when languages are limited to the primary language sub-tag,
    and do not depend on other sub-tags, such as "en-us" ).
    For example, to access the occupation
    in English, a developer would use the following code snippet: obj.occupation.en .

Third, it is possible to override the default language by using a value object :

{
  "@context": { ... "@language": "ja"
  },
  "name": "花澄",
  "occupation": {
    "@value": "Scientist",
    "@language": "en"
  } }

This makes it possible to specify a plain string by omitting the @language tag or setting it to null when expressing
    it using a value object :

{
  "@context": { ... "@language": "ja"
  },
  "name": {
    "@value": "Frank"
  } ,
  "occupation": {
    "@value": "Ninja",
    "@language": "en"
  },
  "speciality": "手裏剣"
}

See § 9.8 Language Maps for a description
    of using language maps to set the language of mapped values.

This section is non-normative.

It is also possible to annotate a string , or language-tagged string ,
      with its base direction .
      As with language, it is possible to define a default base direction for a JSON-LD document
      by setting the @direction key in the context :

{
  "@context": {
    "title": "http://example.org/title",
    "publisher": "http://example.org/publisher", ... "@language": "ar-EG",
    "@direction": "rtl" }, "title": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
  "publisher": "مكتبة" }

[{
  "http://example.org/title": [{"@value": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب" , "@language": "ar-EG", "@direction": "rtl" }],
  "http://example.org/publisher": [{"@value": "مكتبة" , "@language": "ar-EG", "@direction": "rtl" }]
}]

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

# Note that this version drops the base direction.
[
  ex:title "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب" @ar-EG;
  ex:publisher "مكتبة" @ar-EG
] .

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
@prefix i18n: <https://www.w3.org/ns/i18n#> .

# Note that this version preserves the base direction using a datatype.
[
  ex:title "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب"^^i18n:ar-EG_rtl ;
  ex:publisher "مكتبة"^^i18n:ar-EG_rtl ] .

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

# Note that this version preserves the base direction using a bnode structure.
[
  ex:title [
    rdf:value "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
    rdf:language "ar-EG",
    rdf:direction "rtl"
  ] ;
  ex:publisher [
    rdf:value "مكتبة",
    rdf:language "ar-EG",
    rdf:direction "rtl"
  ] ] .

The example above would associate the ar-EG language tag
    and "rtl" base direction
    with the two strings HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب and مكتبة .
    The default base direction applies to all string values that are not type coerced .

To clear the default base direction for a subtree, @direction can
    be set to null in an intervening context, such as a scoped context as follows:

{
  "@context": { ... "@version": 1.1, "@vocab": "http://example.com/",
    "@language": "ar-EG",
    "@direction": "rtl",
    "details": { "@context": {
        "@direction": null
      } }
  },
  "title": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
  "details": {"genre": "Technical Publication"}
}

Second, it is possible to associate a base direction with a specific term using an expanded term definition :

{
  "@context": { ... "@version": 1.1,
    "@language": "ar-EG",
    "@direction": "rtl",
    "ex": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "publisher": { "@id": "ex:publisher", "@direction": null },
    "title": { "@id": "ex:title" },
    "title_en": { "@id": "ex:title", "@language": "en", "@direction": "ltr" }
  }, "publisher": "مكتبة",
  "title": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
  "title_en": "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites" ,
  ... }

The example above would create three properties:

Base direction associations are only applied to plain strings and language-tagged strings . Typed values or values that are subject to type coercion are not given a base direction.

Third, it is possible to override the default base direction by using a value object :

{
  "@context": { ... "@language": "ar-EG",
    "@direction": "rtl"
  },
  "title": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
  "author": {
    "@value": "Jon Duckett",
    "@language": "en",
    "@direction": null
  } }

See Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata [ string-meta ] for a deeper discussion of base direction .


### 4.3 Value Ordering

This section is non-normative.

A JSON-LD author can express multiple values in a compact way by using arrays . Since graphs do not describe ordering for links
  between nodes, arrays in JSON-LD do not convey any ordering of the
  contained elements by default. This is exactly the opposite from regular JSON
  arrays, which are ordered by default. For example, consider the following
  simple document:

{
  "@context": {"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"}, ... "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "foaf:nick": [ "joe", "bob", "JB" ] ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [
    {"@value": "joe"},
    {"@value": "bob"},
    {"@value": "JB"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.org/people#joebob> foaf:nick
  "joe", "bob", "JB" .

Multiple values may also be expressed using the expanded form:

{
  "@context": {"dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"},
  "@id": "http://example.org/articles/8",
  "dcterms:title": [
    {
      "@value": "Das Kapital",
      "@language": "de"
    },
    {
      "@value": "Capital",
      "@language": "en"
    }
  ] }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/articles/8",
  "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title": [
    {"@value": "Das Kapital", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Capital", "@language": "en"}
  ] }]

@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<http://example.org/articles/8> dcterms:title "Das Kapital"@de, "Capital"@en .

The example shown above would generates statement, again with
  no inherent order.

Although multiple values of a property are typically of the same type,
  JSON-LD places no restriction on this, and a property may have values
  of different types:

{
  "@context": {"ex": "http://example.org/"},
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#michael",
  "ex:name": [
    "Michael",
    {"@value": "Mike"},
    {"@value": "Miguel", "@language": "es"},
    { "@id": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4927524" },
    42
  ]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#michael",
  "http://example.org/name": [
    {"@value": "Michael"},
    {"@value": "Mike"},
    {"@value": "Miguel", "@language": "es"},
    {"@id": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4927524" },
    {"@value": 42}
  ] }]

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

<http://example.org/people#michael> ex:name
  "Michael",
  "Mike",
  "Miguel"@es,
  <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4927524>,
  42 .

When viewed as statements, the values have no inherent order.


#### 4.3.1 Lists

This section is non-normative.

As the notion of ordered collections is rather important in data
  modeling, it is useful to have specific language support. In JSON-LD,
  a list may be represented using the @list keyword as follows:

{
  "@context": {"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"}, ... "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "foaf:nick": {
    "@list": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]
  } ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [{
    "@list": [
      {"@value": "joe"},
      {"@value": "bob"},
      {"@value": "jaybee"}
    ]
  }] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.org/people#joebob> foaf:nick ("joe" "bob" "jaybee") .

This describes the use of this array as being ordered,
  and order is maintained when processing a document. If every use of a given multi-valued
  property is a list, this may be abbreviated by setting @container to @list in the context :

{ "@context": { ... "nick": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick",
      "@container": "@list"
    }
  } , ... "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ] ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [{
    "@list": [
      {"@value": "joe"},
      {"@value": "bob"},
      {"@value": "jaybee"}
    ]
  }] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.org/people#joebob> foaf:nick ("joe" "bob" "jaybee") .

The implementation of lists in RDF depends on linking anonymous nodes
  together using the properties rdf:first and rdf:rest , with the end of the list defined as the resource rdf:nil , as the "statements" tab illustrates.
  This allows order to be represented within an unordered set of statements.

Both JSON-LD and Turtle provide shortcuts for representing ordered lists.

In JSON-LD 1.1, lists of lists, where the value of
  a list object , may itself be a list object , are
  fully supported.

Note that the "@container": "@list" definition recursively
  describes array values of lists as being, themselves, lists. For example, in The GeoJSON Format (see [ RFC7946 ]), coordinates are an ordered list of positions , which are
  represented as an array of two or more numbers:

{
  "type": "Feature",
  "bbox": [-10.0, -10.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [-10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, 10.0],
            [-10.0, -10.0]
        ]
    ]
  } //... }

For these examples, it's important that values
  expressed within bbox and coordinates maintain their order,
  which requires the use of embedded list structures. In JSON-LD 1.1, we can
  express this using recursive lists, by simply adding the appropriate context
  definition:

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#",
    "type": "@type",
    "bbox": {"@container": "@list"},
    "coordinates": {"@container": "@list"}
  },
  "type": "Feature",
  "bbox": [-10.0, -10.0, 10.0, 10.0],
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [-10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, -10.0],
            [10.0, 10.0],
            [-10.0, -10.0]
        ]
    ]
  } //... }

[{
  "@type": ["https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#Feature"],
  "https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#bbox": [{
    "@list": [
      {"@value": -10.0},
      {"@value": -10.0},
      {"@value": 10.0},
      {"@value": 10.0}
    ]
  }],
  "https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#geometry": [{
    "@type": ["https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#Polygon"],
    "https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#coordinates": [{
      "@list": [{
        "@list": [
          {"@list": [{"@value": -10.0}, {"@value": -10.0}]},
          {"@list": [{"@value": 10.0}, {"@value": -10.0}]},
          {"@list": [{"@value": 10.0}, {"@value": 10.0}]},
          {"@list": [{"@value": -10.0}, {"@value": -10.0}]}
        ]
      }]
    }]
  }]
}]

@prefix geojson: <https://purl.org/geojson/vocab#>.

[
  a geojson:Feature ;
  geojson:bbox (-10 -10 10 10) ;
  geojson:geometry [
    a geojson:Polygon ;
    geojson:coordinates (
      (
        (-10 -10)
        (10 -10)
        (10 10)
        (-10 -10)
      )
    )
  ]
] .

Note that coordinates includes three levels of lists.

Values of terms associated with an @list container
  are always represented in the form of an array ,
  even if there is just a single value or no value at all.


#### 4.3.2 Sets

This section is non-normative.

While @list is used to describe ordered lists ,
  the @set keyword is used to describe unordered sets .
  The use of @set in the body of a JSON-LD document
  is optimized away when processing the document, as it is just syntactic
  sugar. However, @set is helpful when used within the context
  of a document.
  Values of terms associated with an @set container
  are always represented in the form of an array ,
  even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
  a non-array form in compact form (see § 5.2 Compacted Document Form ). This makes post-processing of
  JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the
  array only contains a single value.

{
  "@context": {"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"}, ... "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "foaf:nick": {
    "@set": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]
  } ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [
    {"@value": "joe"},
    {"@value": "bob"},
    {"@value": "jaybee"}
  ] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.org/people#joebob> foaf:nick "joe", "bob", "jaybee" .

This describes the use of this array as being unordered,
  and order may change when processing a document. By default,
  arrays of values are unordered, but this may be made explicit by
  setting @container to @set in the context :

{ "@context": { ... "nick": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick",
      "@container": "@set"
    }
  } , ... "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ] ,
  ... }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [
    {"@value": "joe"},
    {"@value": "bob"},
    {"@value": "jaybee"}
  ] }]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.org/people#joebob> foaf:nick "joe", "bob", "jaybee" .

Since JSON-LD 1.1, the @set keyword may be
  combined with other container specifications within an expanded term
  definition to similarly cause compacted values of indexes to be consistently
  represented using arrays. See § 4.6 Indexed Values for a further discussion.


#### 4.3.3 Using @set with @type

This section is non-normative.

Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 , @type may be used with an expanded term definition with @container set
    to @set ; no other entries may be set within such an expanded term definition .
    This is used by the Compaction algorithm to ensure that the values of @type (or an alias)
    are always represented in an array .

{ "@context" : { "@version" : 1.1 , "@type" : { "@container" : "@set" }
  }, "@type" : [ "http:/example.org/type" ]
}


### 4.4 Nested Properties

This section is non-normative.

Many JSON APIs separate properties from their entities using an
    intermediate object; in JSON-LD these are called nested properties .
    For example, a set of possible labels may be grouped
    under a common property:

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "skos": "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#", "labels": "@nest" ,
    "main_label": {"@id": "skos:prefLabel"},
    "other_label": {"@id": "skos:altLabel"},
    "homepage": {"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type": "@id"}
  },
  "@id": "http://example.org/myresource",
  "homepage": "http://example.org",
  "labels": {
     "main_label": "This is the main label for my resource",
     "other_label": "This is the other label"
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/myresource",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
    {"@id": "http://example.org"}
  ],
  "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel": [
    {"@value": "This is the main label for my resource"}
  ],
  "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel": [
    {"@value": "This is the other label"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

<http://example.org/myresource>
  skos:prefLabel "This is the main label for my resource";
  skos:altLabel "This is the other label";
  foaf:homepage <http://example.org> .

By defining labels using the keyword @nest ,
    a JSON-LD processor will ignore the nesting created by using the labels property and process the contents as if it were declared
    directly within containing object. In this case, the labels property is semantically meaningless. Defining it as equivalent to @nest causes it to be ignored when expanding, making it
    equivalent to the following:

{
  "@context": {
    "skos": "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#",
    "main_label": {"@id": "skos:prefLabel"},
    "other_label": {"@id": "skos:altLabel"},
    "homepage": {"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage", "@type": "@id"}
  },
  "@id": "http://example.org/myresource",
  "homepage": "http://example.org", "main_label": "This is the main label for my resource",
  "other_label": "This is the other label" }

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/myresource",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
    {"@id": "http://example.org"}
  ],
  "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel": [
    {"@value": "This is the main label for my resource"}
  ],
  "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel": [
    {"@value": "This is the other label"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .

<http://example.org/myresource>
  skos:prefLabel "This is the main label for my resource";
  skos:altLabel "This is the other label";
  foaf:homepage <http://example.org> .

Similarly, term definitions may contain a @nest property
    referencing a term aliased to @nest which will cause such
    properties to be nested under that aliased term when compacting.
    In the example below, both main_label and other_label are defined
    with "@nest": "labels" , which will cause them to be serialized under labels when compacting.

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/myresource",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [

Nested properties are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


### 4.5 Embedding

This section is non-normative.

Embedding is a JSON-LD feature that allows an author to
    use node objects as property values. This is a commonly used mechanism for
    creating a parent-child relationship between two nodes .

Without embedding, node objects can be linked by referencing the
    identifier of another node object . For example:

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "knows": {"@type": "@id"} },
  "@graph": [{
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "@type": "Person", "knows": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me" }, {
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
  }]
}

[{
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
    {"@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"}
  ],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
    {"@value": "Manu Sporny"}
  ]
}, {
  "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
    {"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

[
  a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me>
] .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

The previous example describes two node objects , for Manu and Gregg, with
    the knows property defined to treat string values as identifiers. Embedding allows the node object for Gregg to be embedded as a value
    of the knows property:

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny", "knows": { "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg" } }

[{
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [{
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
      {"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}
    ]
  }],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
    {"@value": "Manu Sporny"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

[
  a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me>
] .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

A node object , like the one used above, may be used in
    any value position in the body of a JSON-LD document.

While it is considered a best practice to identify nodes in a graph,
    at times this is impractical. In the data model, nodes without an explicit
    identifier are called blank nodes , which can be represented in a
    serialization such as JSON-LD using a blank node identifier . In the
    previous example, the top-level node for Manu does not have an identifier,
    and does not need one to describe it within the data model. However, if we
    were to want to describe a knows relationship from Gregg to Manu,
    we would need to introduce a blank node identifier (here _:b0 ).

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  }, "@id": "_:b0", "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "knows": {
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg", "knows": {"@id": "_:b0"} }
}

[{ "@id": "_:b0" ,
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [{
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
      {"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}
    ], "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
      {"@id": "_:b0"}
    ] }],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
    {"@value": "Manu Sporny"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> . _:b0 a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg"; foaf:knows _:b0 .

Blank node identifiers may be automatically introduced by algorithms such as flattening , but they are also useful for authors to describe such relationships directly.


#### 4.5.1 Identifying Blank Nodes

This section is non-normative.

At times, it becomes necessary to be able to express information without
    being able to uniquely identify the node with an IRI .
    This type of node is called a blank node . JSON-LD does not require
    all nodes to be identified using @id . However, some graph topologies
    may require identifiers to be serializable. Graphs containing loops, e.g., cannot
    be serialized using embedding alone, @id must be used to connect the nodes.
    In these situations, one can use blank node identifiers ,
    which look like IRIs using an underscore ( _ )
    as scheme. This allows one to reference the node locally within the document, but
    makes it impossible to reference the node from an external document. The blank node identifier is scoped to the document in which it is used.

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/", ... "@id": " _:n1 ",
   "name": "Secret Agent 1",
   "knows": {
     "name": "Secret Agent 2",
     "knows": { "@id": " _:n1 " }
   }
}

[{ "@id": "_:n1" ,
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Secret Agent 1"}],
  "http://schema.org/knows": [{
    "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Secret Agent 2"}], "http://schema.org/knows": [{"@id": "_:n1"}] }]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> . _:b0 schema:name "Secret Agent 1";
  schema:knows _:b1 .

_:b1 schema:name "Secret Agent 2"; schema:knows _:b0 .

The example above contains information about two secret agents that cannot be identified
    with an IRI . While expressing that agent 1 knows agent 2 is possible without using blank node identifiers ,
    it is necessary to assign agent 1 an identifier so that it can be referenced
    from agent 2 .

It is worth noting that blank node identifiers may be relabeled during processing.
    If a developer finds that they refer to the blank node more than once,
    they should consider naming the node using a dereferenceable IRI so that
    it can also be referenced from other documents.


### 4.6 Indexed Values

This section is non-normative.

Sometimes multiple property values need to be accessed
  in a more direct fashion than iterating though multiple array values. JSON-LD
  provides an indexing mechanism to allow the use of an intermediate map to associate specific indexes with associated values.

See § 4.9 Named Graphs for other uses of indexing in JSON-LD.


#### 4.6.1 Data Indexing

This section is non-normative.

Databases are typically used to make access to
    data more efficient. Developers often extend this sort of functionality into
    their application data to deliver similar performance gains.
    This data may have no meaning from a Linked Data standpoint, but is
    still useful for an application.

JSON-LD introduces the notion of index maps that can be used to structure data into a form that is
    more efficient to access. The data indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys do not map
    to IRIs . This enables direct access to data
    instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the @index keyword with a @container declaration in the context:

{
  "@context": {
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "name": "schema:name",
    "body": "schema:articleBody",
    "athletes": {
      "@id": "schema:athlete", "@container": "@index" },
    "position": "schema:jobTitle"
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/",
  "@type": "schema:SportsTeam",
  "name": "San Francisco Giants", "athletes": {
    "catcher": {
      "@type": "schema:Person",
      "name": "Buster Posey",
      "position": "Catcher"
    },
    "pitcher": {
      "@type": "schema:Person",
      "name": "Madison Bumgarner",
      "position": "Starting Pitcher"
    } ,
    .... }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/",
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/SportsTeam"],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "San Francisco Giants"}], "http://schema.org/athlete": [{
    "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"],
    "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Buster Posey"}],
    "http://schema.org/jobTitle": [{"@value": "Catcher"}],
    "@index": "catcher"
  }, {
    "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"],
    "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Madison Bumgarner"}],
    "http://schema.org/jobTitle": [{"@value": "Starting Pitcher"}],
    "@index": "pitcher"
  } ,
  .... ] }]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

<http://example.com/> a schema:SportsTeam;
  schema:name "San Francisco Giants";
  schema:athlete [
    a schema:Person;
    schema:jobTitle "Catcher";
    schema:name "Buster Posey"
  ], [
    a schema:Person;
    schema:jobTitle "Starting Pitcher";
    schema:name "Madison Bumgarner"
  ] ,
  .... .

In the example above, the athletes term has
    been marked as an index map .
    The catcher and pitcher keys will be ignored  semantically,
    but preserved syntactically, by the JSON-LD Processor .
    If used in JavaScript, this can allow a developer to access a particular athlete using the
    following code snippet: obj.athletes.pitcher .

The interpretation of the data is expressed in the statements table. Note how the index keys do not appear in the statements ,
    but would continue to exist if the document were compacted or
    expanded (see § 5.2 Compacted Document Form and § 5.1 Expanded Document Form ) using a JSON-LD processor .

As data indexes are not preserved when round-tripping to RDF;
    this feature should be used judiciously.
    Often, other indexing mechanisms, which are preserved, are more appropriate.

The value of @container can also
    be an array containing both @index and @set .
    When compacting , this ensures that a JSON-LD Processor will use
    the array form for all values of indexes.

Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 ,
    the special index @none is used for indexing
    data which does not have an associated index, which is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation.

  ], [

This section is non-normative.

In its simplest form (as in the examples above),
      data indexing assigns no semantics to the keys of an index map .
      However, in some situations,
      the keys used to index objects are semantically linked to these objects,
      and should be preserved not only syntactically, but also semantically.

Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 , "@container": "@index" in a term description can be accompanied with
      an "@index" key. The value of that key must map to an IRI ,
      which identifies the semantic property linking each object to its key.

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1, "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "name": "schema:name",
    "body": "schema:articleBody",

  },

    "Catcher": { ↑ "Catcher" will add `"schema:jobTitle": "Catcher"` when expanded "@type": "schema:Person",
      "name": "Buster Posey"
    },
    "Starting Pitcher": {
      "@type": "schema:Person",
      "name": "Madison Bumgarner"
    } ,
    .... }
}

    "http://schema.org/jobTitle": [{"@value": "Catcher"}]
  }, {
    "@type": ["http://schema.org/Person"],
    "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Madison Bumgarner"}],
    "http://schema.org/jobTitle": [{"@value": "Starting Pitcher"}]
  } ,
  .... ] }]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

<http://example.com/> a schema:SportsTeam;
  schema:name "San Francisco Giants";
  schema:athlete [
    a schema:Person;

    schema:name "Buster Posey"
  ], [
    a schema:Person;
    schema:jobTitle "Starting Pitcher";
    schema:name "Madison Bumgarner"
  ] ,
  .... .

When using property-based data indexing, index maps can only be used
    on node objects , not value objects or graph objects . Value objects are restricted to have only certain keys and do not support
    arbitrary properties.


#### 4.6.2 Language Indexing

This section is non-normative.

JSON which includes string values in multiple languages may be
    represented using a language map to allow for easily
    indexing property values by language tag . This enables direct access to
    language values instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the @language keyword with a @container declaration in the context:

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@id": "vocab:label",
      "@container": "@language"
    }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "label": {
    "en": "The Queen",
    "de": [ "Die Königin", "Ihre Majestät" ]
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "http://example.com/vocab/label": [
    {"@value": "The Queen", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "Die Königin", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Ihre Majestät", "@language": "de"}
  ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

<http://example.com/queen> <http://example.com/vocab/label>
     "Ihre Majestät"@de,
     "Die Königin"@de,
     "The Queen"@en .

In the example above, the label term has
    been marked as a language map . The en and de keys are implicitly associated with their respective
    values by the JSON-LD Processor .  This allows a developer to
    access the German version of the label using the
    following code snippet: obj.label.de ,
    which, again, is only appropriate when languages are limited to the
    primary language sub-tag and do not depend on other sub-tags, such as "de-at" .

The value of @container can also
    be an array containing both @language and @set .
    When compacting , this ensures that a JSON-LD Processor will use
    the array form for all values of language tags.

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1, "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@id": "vocab:label",
      "@container": [ "@language", "@set"] }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "label": {
    "en": [ "The Queen" ] ,
    "de": [ "Die Königin", "Ihre Majestät" ]
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "http://example.com/vocab/label": [ {"@value": "The Queen", "@language": "en"} ,
    {"@value": "Die Königin", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Ihre Majestät", "@language": "de"}
  ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

<http://example.com/queen> <http://example.com/vocab/label>
     "Ihre Majestät"@de,
     "Die Königin"@de, "The Queen"@en .

Unless the processing mode is set to json-ld-1.0 ,
    the special index @none is used for indexing
    strings which do not have a language; this is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation for string values not having a datatype.

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@id": "vocab:label",
      "@container": "@language"
    }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "label": {
    "en": "The Queen",
    "de": [ "Die Königin", "Ihre Majestät" ], "@none": "The Queen" }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "http://example.com/vocab/label": [
    {"@value": "The Queen", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "Die Königin", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Ihre Majestät", "@language": "de"}, {"@value": "The Queen"} ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

<http://example.com/queen> <http://example.com/vocab/label>
     "Ihre Majestät"@de,
     "Die Königin"@de,
     "The Queen"@en, "The Queen" .


#### 4.6.3 Node Identifier Indexing

This section is non-normative.

In addition to index maps , JSON-LD introduces the notion of id maps for structuring data. The id indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys map
    to IRIs . This enables direct access to associated node objects instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the @id keyword with a @container declaration in the context:

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "name": "schema:name",
    "body": "schema:articleBody",
    "words": "schema:wordCount",
    "post": {
      "@id": "schema:blogPost", "@container": "@id",
      "@context": {
        "@base": "http://example.com/posts/"
      } }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/",
  "@type": "schema:Blog",
  "name": "World Financial News",
  "post": { "1/en" : {
      "body": "World commodities were up today with heavy trading of crude oil...",
      "words": 1539
    }, "1/de" : {
      "body": "Die Werte an Warenbörsen stiegen im Sog eines starken Handels von Rohöl...",
      "words": 1204
    }
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/",
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/Blog"],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "World Financial News"}],
  "http://schema.org/blogPost": [{ "@id": "http://example.com/posts/1/en", "http://schema.org/articleBody": [
      {"@value": "World commodities were up today with heavy trading of crude oil..."}
    ],
    "http://schema.org/wordCount": [{"@value": 1539}]
  }, { "@id": "http://example.com/posts/1/de", "http://schema.org/articleBody": [
      {"@value": "Die Werte an Warenbörsen stiegen im Sog eines starken Handels von Rohöl..."}
    ],
    "http://schema.org/wordCount": [{"@value": 1204}]
  }]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

   schema:wordCount 1204 . <http://example.com/posts/1/en> schema:articleBody
    "World commodities were up today with heavy trading of crude oil...";
   schema:wordCount 1539 .

In the example above, the post term has
    been marked as an id map . The http://example.com/posts/1/en and http://example.com/posts/1/de keys will be interpreted
    as the @id property of the node object value.

The interpretation of the data above is exactly the same
    as that in § 4.6.1 Data Indexing using a JSON-LD processor .

The value of @container can also
    be an array containing both @id and @set .
    When compacting , this ensures that a JSON-LD processor will use
    the array form for all values of node identifiers.

Id maps are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


#### 4.6.4 Node Type Indexing

This section is non-normative.

In addition to id and index maps , JSON-LD introduces the notion of type maps for structuring data. The type indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys map
    to IRIs . This enables data to be structured based on the @type of specific node objects .
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the @type keyword with a @container declaration in the context:

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "name": "schema:name",
    "affiliation": {
      "@id": "schema:affiliation", "@container": "@type" }
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "affiliation": { "schema:Corporation" : {
      "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/",
      "name": "Digital Bazaar"
    }, "schema:ProfessionalService" : {
      "@id": "https://spec-ops.io",
      "name": "Spec-Ops"
    }
  }
}

[{
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
  "http://schema.org/affiliation": [
    {
      "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/",
      "@type": ["http://schema.org/Corporation"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Digital Bazaar"}]
    }, {
      "@id": "https://spec-ops.io",
      "@type": ["http://schema.org/ProfessionalService"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Spec-Ops"}]
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<https://digitalbazaar.com/> a schema:Corporation;
   schema:name "Digital Bazaar" .

<https://spec-ops.io> a schema:ProfessionalService;
   schema:name "Spec-Ops" .

[
   schema:affiliation <https://digitalbazaar.com/>, <https://spec-ops.io>;
   schema:name "Manu Sporny"
] .

In the example above, the affiliation term has
    been marked as a type map . The schema:Corporation and schema:ProfessionalService keys will be interpreted
    as the @type property of the node object value.

The value of @container can also
    be an array containing both @type and @set .
    When compacting , this ensures that a JSON-LD processor will use
    the array form for all values of types.

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "name": "schema:name",
    "affiliation": {
      "@id": "schema:affiliation",
      "@container": [ "@type", "@set"] }
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "affiliation": {
    "schema:Corporation": [ {
      "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/",
      "name": "Digital Bazaar"
    } ] ,
    "schema:ProfessionalService": [ {
      "@id": "https://spec-ops.io",
      "name": "Spec-Ops"
    } ] }
}

      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Digital Bazaar"}]
    }, {
      "@id": "https://spec-ops.io",
      "@type": ["http://schema.org/ProfessionalService"],
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Spec-Ops"}]
    }
  ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<https://digitalbazaar.com/> a schema:Corporation;

   schema:name "Spec-Ops" .

[
   schema:affiliation <https://digitalbazaar.com/>, <https://spec-ops.io>;
   schema:name "Manu Sporny"
] .

The special index @none is used for indexing node objects which do not have an @type , which is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation. The @none index may also be
    a term which expands to @none , such as the term none used in the example below.

    }, {
      "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/",
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}]
    } ]
}]

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

As with id maps , when used with @type , a container may also
    include @set to ensure that key values are always contained in an array.

Type maps are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


### 4.7 Included Nodes

This section is non-normative.

Sometimes it is also useful to list node objects as part of another node object.
    For instance, to represent a set of resources which are used by some other
    resource. Included blocks may be also be used to collect such secondary node objects which can be referenced from a primary node object .
    For an example, consider a node object containing a list of different items,
    some of which share some common elements:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://example.org/",
    "classification": {"@type": "@vocab"}
  },
  "@id": "http://example.org/org-1",
  "members": [{
    "@id":"http://example.org/person-1",
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "classification": "employee"
  }, {
    "@id":"http://example.org/person-2",
    "name": "Dave Longley",
    "classification": "employee"
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/person-3",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg",
    "classification": "contractor"
  }], "@included": [{
    "@id": "http://example.org/employee",
    "label": "An Employee"
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/contractor",
    "label": "A Contractor"
  }] }

When flattened , this will move the employee and contractor elements
    from the included block into the outer array .

[{
    "@id": "http://example.org/org-1",
    "http://example.org/members": [
      {"@id": "http://example.org/person-1"},
      {"@id": "http://example.org/person-2"},
      {"@id": "http://example.org/person-3"}
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/employee",
    "http://example.org/label": [{"@value": "An Employee"}]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/contractor",
    "http://example.org/label": [{"@value": "A Contractor"}]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/person-1",
    "http://example.org/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
    "http://example.org/classification": [
      {"@id": "http://example.org/employee"}
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/person-2",
    "http://example.org/name": [{"@value": "Dave Longley"}],
    "http://example.org/classification": [
      {"@id": "http://example.org/employee"}
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/person-3",
    "http://example.org/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}],
    "http://example.org/classification": [
      {"@id": "http://example.org/contractor"}
    ]
  }
]

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

ex:org-1 ex:members ex:person-3,
    ex:person-1,
    ex:person-2 .

ex:person-1 ex:classification ex:employee;
  ex:name "Manu Sporny" .

  ex:name "Dave Longley" .

ex:person-3 ex:classification ex:contractor;
  ex:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

Included resources are described in Inclusion of Related Resources of JSON API [ JSON.API ]
    as a way to include related resources associated with some primary resource; @included provides an analogous possibility in JSON-LD.

As a by product of the use of @included within node objects , a map may contain
    only @included , to provide a feature similar to that described in § 4.1 Advanced Context Usage ,
    where @graph is used to described disconnected nodes .

{
  "@context": {
    "Person": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "knows": {"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows", "@type": "@id"}
  }, "@included": [{
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "knows": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"
  }, {
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg",
    "knows": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"
  }] }

[{ "@included": [{
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
      {"@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"}
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
      {"@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"}
    ]
  }] }]

[{
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
    {"@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"}
  ]
}, {
  "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
    {"@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
  foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg";
  foaf:knows <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> .

However, in contrast to @graph , @included does not interact with other properties contained within the same map , a feature discussed further in § 4.9 Named Graphs .


### 4.8 Reverse Properties

This section is non-normative.

JSON-LD serializes directed graphs . That means that
    every property points from a node to another node or value . However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction. Consider for example the case where a person
    and its children should be described in a document. If the used vocabulary does not
    provide a children property but just a parent property , every node representing a child would have to
    be expressed with a property pointing to the parent as in the following
    example.

[
  { "@id": "#homer" ,
    "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Homer"
  }, {
    "@id": "#bart",
    "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Bart", "http://example.com/vocab#parent": { "@id": "#homer" } }, {
    "@id": "#lisa",
    "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Lisa", "http://example.com/vocab#parent": { "@id": "#homer" } }
]

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{"@id": "http://example.org/#homer"}]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.org/#lisa",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Lisa"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{"@id": "http://example.org/#homer"}
  ]
}]

@base <http://example.org/> .
<#homer> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Homer" .

<#bart> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Bart";
   <http://example.com/vocab#parent> <#homer> .

<#lisa> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Lisa";
   <http://example.com/vocab#parent> <#homer> .

Expressing such data is much simpler by using JSON-LD's @reverse keyword :

{
  "@id": "#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Homer", "@reverse" : { "http://example.com/vocab#parent" : [
      {
        "@id": "#bart",
        "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Bart"
      }, {
        "@id": "#lisa",
        "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Lisa"
      }
    ]
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}], "@reverse" : { "http://example.com/vocab#parent" : [{
      "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}]
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/#lisa",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Lisa"}]
    }]
  }
}]

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{"@id": "http://example.org/#homer"}]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.org/#lisa",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Lisa"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{"@id": "http://example.org/#homer"}
  ]
}]

@base <http://example.org/> .
<#homer> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Homer" .

<#bart> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Bart";
   <http://example.com/vocab#parent> <#homer> .

<#lisa> <http://example.com/vocab#name> "Lisa";
   <http://example.com/vocab#parent> <#homer> .

The @reverse keyword can also be used in expanded term definitions to create reverse properties as shown in the following example:

{
  "@context": { "name": "http://example.com/vocab#name", "children": { "@reverse": "http://example.com/vocab#parent" } },
  "@id": "#homer",
  "name": "Homer", "children" : [
    {
      "@id": "#bart",
      "name": "Bart"
    }, {
      "@id": "#lisa",
      "name": "Lisa"
    }
  ]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}], "@reverse" : { "http://example.com/vocab#parent" : [{
      "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}]
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/#lisa",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Lisa"}]
    }]
  }
}]

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}],
  "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{"@id": "http://example.org/#homer"}]

### 4.9 Named Graphs

This section is non-normative.

At times, it is necessary to make statements about a graph itself, rather than just a single node . This can be done by
    grouping a set of nodes using the @graph keyword . A developer may also name data expressed using the @graph keyword by pairing it with an @id keyword as shown in the following example:

{
  "@context": {
    "generatedAt": {
      "@id": "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#generatedAtTime",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
    },
    "Person": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "knows": {"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows", "@type": "@id"}
  }, "@id": "http://example.org/foaf-graph",
  "generatedAt": "2012-04-09T00:00:00",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Manu Sporny",
      "knows": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"
    }, {
      "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Gregg Kellogg",
      "knows": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"
    }
  ]
}

[{ "@id": "http://example.org/foaf-graph",
  "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#generatedAtTime": [{
    "@value": "2012-04-09T00:00:00",
    "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
  }] ,
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
      {"@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"}
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
      {"@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"}
    ]
  }]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://example.org/foaf-graph> prov:generatedAtTime "2012-04-09T00:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime .

<http://example.org/foaf-graph> {
  <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person;
     foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
     foaf:knows <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> .

  <https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
     foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg";
     foaf:knows <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> .
}

The example above expresses a named graph that is identified
    by the IRI http://example.org/foaf-graph . That
    graph is composed of the statements about Manu and Gregg. Metadata about
    the graph itself is expressed via the generatedAt property,
    which specifies when the graph was generated.

When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is a map that contains no other
    keys than @graph and
    optionally @context (properties that are not mapped to an IRI or a keyword are ignored), @graph is considered to express the otherwise implicit default graph . This mechanism can be useful when a number
    of nodes exist at the document's top level that
    share the same context , which is, e.g., the case when a
    document is flattened . The @graph keyword collects such nodes in an array and allows the use of a shared context.

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  " @graph ": [
    {
      "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Manu Sporny"
    }, {
      "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
    }
  ]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Manu Sporny"}]
},
{
  "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "Gregg Kellogg"}]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a foaf:Person;
   foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" .

<http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person;
   foaf:name "Manu Sporny" .

In this case, embedding can not be used as
    the graph contains unrelated nodes.
    This is equivalent to using multiple node objects in array and defining
    the @context within each node object :

[
  { "@context": {
      "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
      "knows": {"@type": "@id"}
    }, "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "knows": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"
  },
  { "@context": {
      "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
      "knows": {"@type": "@id"}
    }, "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg",
    "knows": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu"
  }
]

[{
  "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
  "@type": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"],

#### 4.9.1 Graph Containers

This section is non-normative.

In some cases, it is useful to logically partition data into separate
      graphs, without making this explicit within the JSON expression. For
      example, a JSON document may contain data against which other metadata is
      asserted and it is useful to separate this data in the data model using
      the notion of named graphs , without the syntactic overhead
      associated with the @graph keyword.

An expanded term definition can use @graph as the
      value of @container . This indicates that values of this term should be considered to be named graphs , where the graph name is an automatically assigned blank node identifier creating an implicitly named graph . When expanded, these become simple graph objects .

A different example uses an anonymously named graph as follows:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@base": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/",
    "said": "http://example.com/said", "wrote": {"@id": "http://example.com/wrote", "@container": "@graph"} },
  "@id": "William_Shakespeare", "wrote" : {
    "@id": "Richard_III_of_England",
    "said": "My kingdom for a horse"
  }
}

[{
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare", "http://example.com/wrote" : [{ "@graph" : [{
      "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_III_of_England",
      "http://example.com/said": [{"@value": "My kingdom for a horse"}]
    }]
  }]
}]

@prefix dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> .
@prefix ex:  <http://example.com/> .

dbp:William_Shakespeare ex:wrote _:b0 .

_:b0 {
  dbp:Richard_III_of_England ex:said "My kingdom for a horse" .
}

The example above expresses an anonymously named graph making a statement. The default graph includes a statement
      saying that the subject wrote that statement.
      This is an example of separating statements into a named graph , and then
      making assertions about the statements contained within that named graph .

Strictly speaking, the value of such a term is not a named graph , rather it is the graph name associated with the named graph , which exists separately within
      the dataset .

Graph Containers are a new feature in JSON-LD 1.1.


#### 4.9.2 Named Graph Data Indexing

This section is non-normative.

In addition to indexing node objects by index, graph objects may
    also be indexed by an index. By using the @graph container type, introduced in § 4.9.1 Graph Containers in addition to @index , an object value of such a property is
    treated as a key-value map where the keys do not map to IRIs , but
    are taken from an @index property associated with named graphs which are their values. When expanded, these must be simple graph objects

The following example describes a default graph referencing multiple named
    graphs using an index map .

{
  "@context": { "@version": 1.1 ,
     "schema": "http://schema.org/",
     "name": "schema:name",
     "body": "schema:articleBody",

     },
     "de": {
       "@id": "http://example.com/posts/1/de",
       "body": "Die Werte an Warenbörsen stiegen im Sog eines starken Handels von Rohöl...",
       "words": 1204
     } }
}

      }],
      "http://schema.org/wordCount": [{"@value": 1204}]
    }],
    "@index": "de"
  }]

As with index maps , when used with @graph , a container may also
    include @set to ensure that key values are always contained in an array.

The special index @none is used for indexing
    graphs which do not have an @index key, which is useful to maintain
    a normalized representation. Note, however, that
      compacting a document where multiple unidentified named graphs are
      compacted using the @none index will result in the content
      of those graphs being merged. To prevent this, give each graph a distinct @index key.

### 4.10 Loading Documents

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ]
    defines the interface to a JSON-LD Processor and includes
    a number of methods used for manipulating different forms
    of JSON-LD (see § 5. Forms of JSON-LD ).
    This includes a general mechanism for loading remote documents,
    including referenced JSON-LD documents and remote contexts,
    and potentially extracting embedded JSON-LD from other formats such as [ HTML ].
    This is more fully described in Remote Document and Context Retrieval in [ JSON-LD11-API ].

A documentLoader can be useful in a number of contexts where loading remote documents can be problematic:

Remote context documents should be cached to prevent overloading the
      location of the remote context for each request.
      Normally, an HTTP caching infrastructure might be expected to handle this,
      but in some contexts this might not be feasible.
      A documentLoader implementation might provide separate logic for performing
      such caching.

Non-standard URL schemes may not be widely implemented,
      or may have behavior specific to a given application domain.
      A documentLoader can be defined to implement document retrieval semantics.

Certain well-known contexts may be statically cached within a documentLoader implementation.
      This might be particularly useful in embedded applications,
      where it is not feasible, or even possible, to access remote documents.

For security purposes, the act of remotely retrieving a document may provide a signal of application behavior.
      The judicious use of a documentLoader can isolate the application and reduce its online fingerprint.


## 5. Forms of JSON-LD

This section is non-normative.

As with many data formats, there is no single correct way to describe data in JSON-LD.
  However, as JSON-LD is used for describing graphs, certain transformations can be used
  to change the shape of the data, without changing its meaning as Linked Data.


### 5.1 Expanded Document Form

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ]
    defines a method for expanding a JSON-LD document. Expansion is the process of taking a JSON-LD document and applying a context such that all IRIs, types, and values
    are expanded so that the @context is no longer necessary.

For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:

{
   "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
   },
   "name": "Manu Sporny",
   "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
}

Running the JSON-LD Expansion algorithm against the JSON-LD input document
    provided above would result in the following output:

[
  {
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
      { "@value": "Manu Sporny" }
    ],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
      { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/" }
    ]
  }
]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

[
  foaf:name "Manu Sporny";
  foaf:homepage <http://manu.sporny.org/>
] .

JSON-LD's media type defines a profile parameter which can be used to signal or request expanded document form . The profile URI identifying expanded document form is http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded .


### 5.2 Compacted Document Form

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ] defines
    a method for compacting a JSON-LD document. Compaction is the process
    of applying a developer-supplied context to shorten IRIs to terms or compact IRIs and JSON-LD values expressed in expanded form to simple values such as strings or numbers .
    Often this makes it simpler to work with document as the data is expressed in
    application-specific terms. Compacted documents are also typically easier to read
    for humans.

For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:

[
  {
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [ "Manu Sporny" ],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
      {
       "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
      }
    ]
  }
]

Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD context:

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }
}

Running the JSON-LD Compaction algorithm given the context supplied above
    against the JSON-LD input document provided above would result in the following
    output:

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
}

JSON-LD's media type defines a profile parameter which can be used to signal or request compacted document form . The profile URI identifying compacted document form is http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted .

The details of Compaction are described in the Compaction algorithm in [ JSON-LD11-API ].
    This section provides a short description of how the algorithm operates as a guide
    to authors creating contexts to be used for compacting JSON-LD documents.

The purpose of compaction is to apply the term definitions , vocabulary mapping , default language ,
    and base IRI to an existing JSON-LD document to cause it to be represented in a form
    that is tailored to the use of the JSON-LD document directly as JSON.
    This includes representing values as strings , rather than value objects , where possible,
    shortening the use of list objects into simple arrays , reversing the relationship
    between nodes , and using data maps to index into multiple values instead of
    representing them as an array of values.


#### 5.2.1 Shortening IRIs

This section is non-normative.

In an expanded JSON-LD document, IRIs are always represented as absolute IRIs .
      In many cases, it is preferable to use a shorter version, either a relative IRI reference , compact IRI , or term . Compaction uses a combination of elements
      in a context to create a shorter form of these IRIs. See § 4.1.2 Default Vocabulary , § 4.1.3 Base IRI ,
      and § 4.1.5 Compact IRIs for more details.

The vocabulary mapping can be used to shorten IRIs that may be vocabulary relative by removing the IRI prefix that matches the vocabulary mapping .
      This is done whenever an IRI is determined to be vocabulary relative,
      i.e., used as a property , or a value of @type ,
      or as the value of a term described as "@type": "@vocab" .

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": ["http://example.org/Restaurant"],
  "http://example.org/name": [{"@value": "Brew Eats"}]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": { "@vocab": "http://example.org/" }
}

The compaction algorithm will shorten all vocabulary-relative IRIs that begin with http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ :

{
  "@context": { "@vocab": "http://example.org/" },
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "@type": "Restaurant" , "name" : "Brew Eats"
}

Note that two IRIs were shortened, unnecessary arrays are removed, and simple string
        values are replaced with the string.

See Security Considerations in § C. IANA Considerations for a discussion on how string vocabulary-relative IRI resolution via concatenation.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/document.jsonld",
  "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label": [{"@value": "Just a simple document"}]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": { "@base": "http://example.com/" ,
    "label": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"
  }
}

The compaction algorithm will shorten all document-relative IRIs that begin with http://example.com/ :

{
  "@context": { "@base": "http://example.com/" ,
    "label": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"
  },
  "@id": "document.jsonld" ,
  "label": "Just a simple document"
}


#### 5.2.2 Representing Values as Strings

This section is non-normative.

To be unambiguous, the expanded document form always represents nodes and values using node objects and value objects .
      Moreover, property values are always contained within an array, even when there is only
      one value. Sometimes this is useful to maintain a uniformity of access,
      but most JSON data use the simplest possible representation, meaning that properties have single values, which are represented as strings or as structured values such as node objects .
      By default, compaction will represent values which are simple strings as strings ,
      but sometimes a value is an IRI , a date, or some other typed value for which
      a simple string representation would loose information.
      By specifying this within a term definition ,
      the semantics of a string value can be inferred from the definition
      of the term used as a property .
      See § 4.2 Describing Values for more details.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "http://example.com/plain": [
    {"@value": "string"},
    {"@value": true},
    {"@value": 1}
  ],
  "http://example.com/date": [
    {
      "@value": "2018-02-16",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"
    }
  ],
  "http://example.com/en": [
    {"@value": "English", "@language": "en"}
  ],
  "http://example.com/iri": [
    {"@id": "http://example.com/some-location"}
  ]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://example.com/",
    "date": {"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"},
    "en":   {"@language": "en"},
    "iri": {"@type": "@id"}
  }
}

The compacted version will use string values for the defined terms
        when the values match the term definition . Note that there is
        no term defined for "plain", that is created automatically using
        the vocabulary mapping .
        Also, the other native values, 1 and true ,
        can be represented without defining a specific type mapping.

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://example.com/",
    "date": {"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"},
    "en":   {"@language": "en"},
    "iri": {"@type": "@id"}
  },
  "plain": ["string", true, 1],
  "date": "2018-02-16",
  "en": "English",
  "iri": "http://example.com/some-location"
}


#### 5.2.3 Representing Lists as Arrays

This section is non-normative.

As described in § 4.3.1 Lists ,
      JSON-LD has an expanded syntax for representing ordered values,
      using the @list keyword.
      To simplify the representation in JSON-LD, a term can be defined with "@container": "@list" which causes all values of a
      property using such a term to be considered ordered.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick": [{
    "@list": [
      {"@value": "joe"},
      {"@value": "bob"},
      {"@value": "jaybee"}
    ]
  }]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "nick": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick", "@container": "@list" }
  }
}

The compacted version eliminates the explicit list object .

{
  "@context": {
    "nick": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick", "@container": "@list" }
  },
  "nick": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ] }


#### 5.2.4 Reversing Node Relationships

This section is non-normative.

In some cases, the property used to relate two nodes may
      be better expressed if the nodes have a reverse direction,
      for example, when describing a relationship between
      two people and a common parent.
      See § 4.8 Reverse Properties for more details.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.org/#homer",
  "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Homer"}],
  "@reverse": {
    "http://example.com/vocab#parent": [{
      "@id": "http://example.org/#bart",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Bart"}]
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/#lisa",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": [{"@value": "Lisa"}]
    }]
  }
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://example.com/vocab#name",
    "children": { "@reverse": "http://example.com/vocab#parent" }
  }
}

The compacted version eliminates the @reverse property
        by describing "children" as the reverse of "parent".

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://example.com/vocab#name",
    "children": { "@reverse": "http://example.com/vocab#parent" }
  },
  "@id": "#homer",
  "name": "Homer",
  "children": [
    { "@id": "#bart", "name": "Bart"},
    { "@id": "#lisa", "name": "Lisa"}
  ]
}

Reverse properties can be even more useful when combined with framing , which can actually make node objects defined
      at the top-level of a document to become embedded nodes.
      JSON-LD provides a means to index such values, by defining
      an appropriate @container definition within a term definition.


#### 5.2.5 Indexing Values

This section is non-normative.

Properties with multiple values are typically represented using
      an unordered array . This means that an application working
      on an internalized representation of that JSON would need to
      iterate through the values of the array to find a value matching
      a particular pattern, such as a language-tagged string using the language en .

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "http://example.com/vocab/label": [
    {"@value": "The Queen", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "Die Königin", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Ihre Majestät", "@language": "de"}
  ]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@id": "vocab:label", "@container": "@language" }
  }
}

The compacted version uses a map value
        for "label", with the keys representing the language tag and the values are the strings associated with the relevant language tag .

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@id": "vocab:label", "@container": "@language" }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "label": {
    "en": "The Queen",
    "de": [ "Die Königin", "Ihre Majestät" ]
  }
}

Data can be indexed on a number of different keys, including
      @id, @type, @language, @index and more.
      See § 4.6 Indexed Values and § 4.9 Named Graphs for more details.


#### 5.2.6 Normalizing Values as Objects

This section is non-normative.

Sometimes it's useful to compact a document, but keep the
      node object and value object representations.
      For this, a term definition can set "@type": "@none" .
      This causes the Value Compaction algorithm to always use the object
      form of values, although components of that value may be compacted.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "http://example.com/notype": [
    {"@value": "string"},
    {"@value": true},
    {"@value": false},
    {"@value": 1},
    {"@value": 10.0},
    {"@value": "plain"},
    {"@value": "false", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean"},
    {"@value": "english", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "2018-02-17", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"},
    {"@id": "http://example.com/iri"}
  ]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "notype": {"@id": "http://example.com/notype", "@type": "@none"}
  }
}

The compacted version will use string values for the defined terms
        when the values match the term definition .
        Also, the other native values, 1 and true ,
        can be represented without defining a specific type mapping.

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "notype": {"@id": "http://example.com/notype", "@type": "@none"}
  },
  "notype": [
    {"@value": "string"},
    {"@value": true},
    {"@value": false},
    {"@value": 1},
    {"@value": 10.0},
    {"@value": "plain"},
    {"@value": "false", "@type": "xsd:boolean"},
    {"@value": "english", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "2018-02-17", "@type": "xsd:date"},
    {"@id": "http://example.com/iri"}
  ]
}


#### 5.2.7 Representing Singular Values as Arrays

This section is non-normative.

Generally, when compacting, properties having only one value are
      represented as strings or maps , while properties having
      multiple values are represented as an array of strings or maps .
      This means that applications accessing such properties need to be prepared
      to accept either representation. To force all values to be represented
      using an array, a term definition can set "@container": "@set" .
      Moreover, @set can be used in combination with other container settings,
      for example looking at our language-map example from § 5.2.5 Indexing Values :

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "http://example.com/vocab/label": [
    {"@value": "The Queen", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "Die Königin", "@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "Ihre Majestät", "@language": "de"}
  ]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@container": ["@language", "@set" ]
    }
  }
}

The compacted version uses a map value
        for "label" as before,
        and the values are the relevant strings but always represented using an array .

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "label": {
      "@container": ["@language", "@set" ]
    }
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/queen",
  "label": {
    "en": [ "The Queen" ] ,
    "de": [ "Die Königin", "Ihre Majestät" ]
  }
}


#### 5.2.8 Term Selection

This section is non-normative.

When compacting, the Compaction algorithm will compact using a term
      for a property only when the values of that property match the @container , @type , and @language specifications for that term definition .
      This can actually split values between different properties, all of which
      have the same IRI . In case there is no matching term definition ,
      the compaction algorithm will compact using the absolute IRI of the property.

Given the following expanded document:

[{
  "http://example.com/vocab/property": [
    {"@value": "string"},
    {"@value": true},
    {"@value": 1},
    {"@value": "false", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean"},
    {"@value": "10", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer"},
    {"@value": "english", "@language": "en"},
    {"@value": "2018-02-17", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"},
    {"@id": "http://example.com/some-location"}
  ]
}]

And the following context:

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab":   "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "xsd":     "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "integer": {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "xsd:integer"},
    "date":    {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "xsd:date"},
    "english": {"@id": "vocab:property", "@language": "en"},
    "list":    {"@id": "vocab:property", "@container": "@list"},
    "iri":     {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "@id"}
  }
}

Note that the values that match the "integer", "english", "date", and "iri"
        terms are properly matched, and that everything that does not explicitly
        match is added to a property created using a compact IRI .

{
  "@context": {
    "vocab":   "http://example.com/vocab/",
    "xsd":     "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "integer": {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "xsd:integer"},
    "date":    {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "xsd:date"},
    "english": {"@id": "vocab:property", "@language": "en"},
    "list":    {"@id": "vocab:property", "@container": "@list"},
    "iri":     {"@id": "vocab:property", "@type": "@id"}
  },
  "vocab:property": [
    "string", true, 1,
    {"@value": "false", "@type": "xsd:boolean"}
  ],
  "integer": "10",
  "english": "english",
  "date": "2018-02-17",
  "iri": "http://example.com/some-location"
}


### 5.3 Flattened Document Form

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ] defines
    a method for flattening a JSON-LD document. Flattening collects all
    properties of a node in a single map and labels
    all blank nodes with blank node identifiers .
    This ensures a shape of the data and consequently may drastically simplify the code
    required to process JSON-LD in certain applications.

For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
  },
  "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "knows": [
    {
      "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
      "name": "Manu Sporny"
    }, {
      "name": "Dave Longley"
    }
  ]
}

Running the JSON-LD Flattening algorithm against the JSON-LD input document in
    the example above and using the same context would result in the following
    output:

{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
  },
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
    "knows": [
      { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" },
      { "@id": "_:b0" }
    ]
  }, {
    "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
    "name": "Manu Sporny"
  }, {
    "@id": "_:b0",
    "name": "Dave Longley"
  }]
}

JSON-LD's media type defines a profile parameter which can be used to signal or request flattened document form . The profile URI identifying flattened document form is http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened .
    It can be combined with the profile URI identifying expanded document form or compacted document form .


### 5.4 Framed Document Form

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Framing specification [ JSON-LD11-FRAMING ] defines
    a method for framing a JSON-LD document. Framing is used to shape
    the data in a JSON-LD document, using an example frame document
    which is used to both match the flattened data and show an example
    of how the resulting data should be shaped.

For example, assume the following JSON-LD frame:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://example.org/"
  },
  "@type": "Library",
  "contains": {
    "@type": "Book",
    "contains": {
      "@type": "Chapter"
    }
  }
}

This frame document describes an embedding structure that would place
    objects with type Library at the top, with objects of
    type Book that were linked to the library object using
    the contains property embedded as property values. It also
    places objects of type Chapter within the referencing Book object
    as embedded values of the Book object.

When using a flattened set of objects that match the frame components:

{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://example.org/",
    "contains": {"@type": "@id"}
  },
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "http://example.org/library",
    "@type": "Library",
    "contains": "http://example.org/library/the-republic"
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic",
    "@type": "Book",
    "creator": "Plato",
    "title": "The Republic",
    "contains": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction"
  }, {
    "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction",
    "@type": "Chapter",
    "description": "An introductory chapter on The Republic.",
    "title": "The Introduction"
  }]
}

The Frame Algorithm can create a new document which follows the structure
    of the frame:

{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://example.org/"
  },
  "@id": "http://example.org/library",
  "@type": "Library",
  "contains": {
    "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic",
    "@type": "Book",
    "contains": {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction",
      "@type": "Chapter",
      "description": "An introductory chapter on The Republic.",
      "title": "The Introduction"
    },
    "creator": "Plato",
    "title": "The Republic"
  }
}

JSON-LD's media type defines a profile parameter which can be used to signal or request framed document form . The profile URI identifying framed document form is http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#framed .

JSON-LD's media type also defines a profile parameter which can be used to identify a script element in an HTML document containing a frame.
    The first script element of type application/ld+json;profile=http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#frame will be used to find a frame ..


## 6. Modifying Behavior with Link Relationships

Certain aspects of JSON-LD processing can be modified using HTTP Link Headers [ RFC8288 ].
    These can be used when retrieving resources that are not, themselves, JSON-LD,
    but can be interpreted as JSON-LD by using information in a Link Relation .

When processing normal JSON documents, a link relation can be specified using
    the HTTP Link Header returned when fetching a remote document, as described in § 6.1 Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD .

In other cases, a resource may be returned using a representation that cannot easily be interpreted
    as JSON-LD. Normally, HTTP content negotiation would be used to allow a client to specify a preference for JSON-LD over another representation,
    but in certain situations, it is not possible or practical for a server to respond appropriately to such requests.
    For this, an HTTP Link Header can be used to provide an alternate location for a document
    to be used in place of the originally requested resource,
    as described in § 6.2 Alternate Document Location .


### 6.1 Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD

Ordinary JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD
    by providing an explicit JSON-LD context document. One way
    to provide this is by using referencing a JSON-LD context document in an HTTP Link Header .
    Doing so allows JSON to be unambiguously machine-readable without requiring developers to drastically
    change their documents and provides an upgrade path for existing infrastructure
    without breaking existing clients that rely on the application/json media type or a media type with a +json suffix as defined in
    [ RFC6839 ].

In order to use an external context with an ordinary JSON document,
    when retrieving an ordinary JSON document via HTTP, processors MUST attempt to retrieve any JSON-LD document referenced by a Link Header with:

rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context" , and

type="application/ld+json" .

The referenced document MUST have a top-level JSON object .
    The @context entry within that object is added to the top-level JSON object of the referencing document. If an array is at the top-level of the referencing document and its items are JSON objects , the @context subtree is added to all array items. All extra information located outside
    of the @context subtree in the referenced document MUST be
    discarded. Effectively this means that the active context is
    initialized with the referenced external context . A response MUST NOT contain more than one HTTP Link Header using the http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context link relation.

Other mechanisms for providing a JSON-LD Context MAY be described for other
    URI schemes.

The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ]
    provides for an expandContext option for specifying
    a context to use when expanding JSON documents programmatically.

The following example demonstrates the use of an external context with an
    ordinary JSON document over HTTP:

GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

====================================

HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... Content-Type: application/json Link: <https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json" {
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "image": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler"
}

Please note that JSON-LD documents served with the application/ld+json media type MUST have all context information, including references to external
    contexts, within the body of the document. Contexts linked via a http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context HTTP Link Header MUST be
    ignored for such documents.


### 6.2 Alternate Document Location

Documents which can't be directly interpreted as JSON-LD can provide an alternate location containing JSON-LD.
    One way to provide this is by referencing a JSON-LD document in an HTTP Link Header .
    This might be useful, for example, when the URL associated with a namespace naturally
    contains an HTML document, but the JSON-LD context associated with that URL is located elsewhere.

To specify an alternate location, a non-JSON resource
    (i.e., one using a media type other than application/json or a derivative)
    can return the alternate location using a Link Header with:

rel="alternate" , and

type="application/ld+json" .

A response MUST NOT contain more than one HTTP Link Header using the alternate link relation with type="application/ld+json" .

Other mechanisms for providing an alternate location MAY be described for other
    URI schemes.

The following example demonstrates the use of an alternate location with an
    ordinary HTTP document over HTTP:

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

====================================

HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... Content-Type: text/html Link: <alternate.jsonld>; rel="alternate"; type="application/ld+json" <html>
  <head>
    <title>Primary Entrypoint</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is the primary entrypoint for a vocabulary</p>
  </body>
</html>

A processor seeing a non-JSON result will note the presence of the link header
    and load that document instead.


## 7. Embedding JSON-LD in HTML Documents

This section describes features available
    with a documentLoader supporting HTML script extraction .
    See Remote Document and Context Retrieval for more information.

JSON-LD content can be easily embedded in HTML [ HTML ] by placing
    it in a script element with the type attribute set to application/ld+json . Doing so creates a data block .

<script type="application/ld+json"> {
  "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon",
  "name": "John Lennon",
  "born": "1940-10-09",
  "spouse": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon"
} </script>

[{
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "John Lennon"}],
  "http://schema.org/birthDate": [
    {"@value": "1940-10-09", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"}
  ],
  "http://schema.org/spouse": [
    {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon"}
  ]
}]

@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon> foaf:name "John Lennon";
   schema:birthDate "1940-10-09"^^xsd:date;
   schema:spouse <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon> .

Defining how such data may be used is beyond the scope of this specification.
    The embedded JSON-LD document might be extracted as is or, e.g., be
    interpreted as RDF.

If JSON-LD content is extracted as RDF [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ], it MUST be expanded into an RDF Dataset using the Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF Algorithm [ JSON-LD11-API ]. Unless a specific script is targeted
    (see § 7.3 Locating a Specific JSON-LD Script Element ),
    all script elements with type application/ld+json MUST be processed and merged
    into a single dataset with equivalent blank node identifiers contained in
    separate script elements treated as if they were in a single document (i.e.,
    blank nodes are shared between different JSON-LD script elements).

<p>Data describing Dave</p>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/author/dlongley/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Dave Longley"
}
</script>

<p>Data describing Gregg</p>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
}
</script>

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

<https://digitalbazaar.com/author/dlongley/> a schema:Person;
   schema:name "Dave Longley" .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a schema:Person;
   schema:name "Gregg Kellogg" .


### 7.1 Inheriting base IRI from HTML's base element

When processing a JSON-LD script element ,
      the Document Base URL of the containing HTML document,
      as defined in [ HTML ],
      is used to establish the default base IRI of the enclosed
      JSON-LD content.

<html>
  <head>
    <base href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/"/> <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",
      "@id": "John_Lennon" ,
      "name": "John Lennon",
      "born": "1940-10-09",
      "spouse": "Cynthia_Lennon" }
    </script> </head>
</html>

[{
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [{"@value": "John Lennon"}],
  "http://schema.org/birthDate": [
    {"@value": "1940-10-09", "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date"}
  ],
  "http://schema.org/spouse": [
    {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon"}
  ]
}]

@base <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

<John_Lennon> foaf:name "John Lennon";
   schema:birthDate "1940-10-09"^^xsd:date;
   schema:spouse <Cynthia_Lennon> .

HTML allows for Dynamic changes to base URLs .
      This specification does not require any specific behavior,
      and to ensure that all systems process the base IRI equivalently, authors SHOULD either use IRIs , or explicitly as defined in § 4.1.3 Base IRI .
      Implementations (particularly those natively operating in the [ DOM ]) MAY take into consideration Dynamic changes to base URLs .


### 7.2 Restrictions for contents of JSON-LD script elements

This section is non-normative.

Due to the HTML Restrictions for contents of <script> elements additional encoding restrictions are placed on JSON-LD data contained in script elements .

Authors should avoid using character sequences in scripts embedded in HTML
      which may be confused with a comment-open , script-open , comment-close , or script-close .

&amp; → & ( ampersand , U+0026)

&lt; → < (less-than sign, U+003C)

&gt; → > (greater-than sign, U+003E)

&quot; → " (quotation mark, U+0022)

&apos; → ' (apostrophe, U+0027)

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "WebPageElement",
  "name": "Encoding Issues",
  "description": "Issues list such as unescaped &lt;/script&gt; or --&gt;"
}
</script>

[{
  "@type": ["http://schema.org/WebPageElement"],
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Encoding Issues"}],
  "http://schema.org/description": [
    {"@value": "Issues list such as unescaped &lt;/script&gt; or --&gt;"}
  ]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

[ a schema:WebPageElement;
  schema:name "Encoding Issues";
  schema:description "Issues list such as unescaped &lt;/script&gt; or --&gt;"
] .


### 7.3 Locating a Specific JSON-LD Script Element

A specific script element within an HTML document may be located using
      a fragment identifier matching the unique identifier of the script element within the HTML document located by a URL (see [ DOM ]).
      A JSON-LD processor MUST extract only the specified data block's contents
      parsing it as a standalone JSON-LD document and MUST NOT merge the result with any other markup from the same HTML document.

For example, given an HTML document located at http://example.com/document ,
      a script element identified by "dave" can be targeted using the URL http://example.com/document#dave .

Targeting a script element with id "gregg"

<p>Data describing Dave</p>
<script id="dave" type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@id": "https://digitalbazaar.com/author/dlongley/",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Dave Longley"
}
</script>

<p>Data describing Gregg</p>
<script id="gregg" type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@id": "https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
}
</script>

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

<https://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me> a schema:Person;
   schema:name "Gregg Kellogg" .


## 8. Data Model

JSON-LD is a serialization format for Linked Data based on JSON.
    It is therefore important to distinguish between the syntax, which is
    defined by JSON in [ RFC8259 ], and the data model which is
    an extension of the RDF data model [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ].
    The precise details of how JSON-LD relates to the RDF data model are given in § 10. Relationship to RDF .

To ease understanding for developers unfamiliar with the RDF model, the
    following summary is provided:

A JSON-LD document serializes a RDF Dataset [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ], which is a collection of graphs that comprises exactly one default graph and zero or more named graphs .

The default graph does not have a name and MAY be empty.

Each named graph is a pair consisting of an IRI or blank node identifier (the graph name )
      and a graph . Whenever practical, the graph name SHOULD be an IRI .

A graph is a labeled directed graph, i.e., a set of nodes connected by directed-arcs.

Every directed-arc is labeled with
      an IRI or a blank node identifier . Within the JSON-LD syntax
      these arc labels are called properties .
      Whenever practical, a directed-arc SHOULD be labeled with an IRI . Note The use of blank node identifiers to label properties is obsolete,
        and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD.
        Consider using a document-relative IRI , instead, such as # .

Every node is an IRI , a blank node , or a literal ,
      although syntactically lists and native JSON values may be represented directly.

A node having an outgoing edge MUST be an IRI or a blank node .

A graph MUST NOT contain unconnected nodes ,
      i.e., nodes which are not connected by an property to any other node . Example 149 : Illegal Unconnected Node { "@id" : "http://example.org/1" } Note This effectively just prohibits unnested, empty node objects and unnested node objects that contain only an @id .
        A document may have nodes which are unrelated, as long as one or more
        properties are defined, or the node is referenced from another node object .

{ "@id" : "http://example.org/1" }

An IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) is a string that conforms to the syntax
      defined in [ RFC3987 ]. IRIs used within a graph SHOULD return a Linked Data document describing
      the resource denoted by that IRI when being dereferenced.

A blank node is a node which is neither an IRI ,
      nor a JSON-LD value , nor a list . A blank node is identified
      using a blank node identifier .

A blank node identifier is a string that can be used as an identifier for a blank node within
      the scope of a JSON-LD document . Blank node identifiers begin with _: .

A JSON-LD value is a typed value , a string (which is interpreted
      as a typed value with type xsd:string ), a number ( numbers with a non-zero fractional part, i.e., the result of a modulo‑1 operation, or which are too large to represent as integers
        (see Data Round Tripping ) in [ JSON-LD11-API ]), are interpreted as typed values with type xsd:double , all other numbers are interpreted as typed values with type xsd:integer ), true or false (which are interpreted as typed values with type xsd:boolean ),
      or a language-tagged string .

A typed value consists of a value, which is a string, and a type, which is an IRI .

A language-tagged string consists of a string and a non-empty language tag as defined by [ BCP47 ].
      The language tag MUST be well-formed according to section 2.2.9 Classes of Conformance of [ BCP47 ]. Processors MAY normalize language tags to lowercase.

Either strings , or language-tagged strings may include
      a base direction , which represents an extension to the underlying RDF data model .

A list is a sequence of zero or more IRIs , blank nodes , and JSON-LD values . Lists are interpreted as RDF list structures [ RDF11-MT ].

JSON-LD documents MAY contain data
    that cannot be represented by the data model defined above. Unless otherwise specified, such data is ignored when a JSON-LD document is being processed. One result of this rule
    is that properties which are not mapped to an IRI ,
    a blank node , or keyword will be ignored.

Additionally, the JSON serialization format is internally represented using
    the JSON-LD internal representation , which uses the generic
    concepts of lists , maps , strings , numbers , booleans , and null to describe
    the data represented by a JSON document.

The image depicts a linked data dataset with a default graph
        and two named graphs.

The dataset described in this figure can be represented as follows:

{
  "@context": [
    "http://schema.org/",
    {"@base": "http://example.com/"}
  ],
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "people/alice",
    "gender": [
      {"@value": "weiblich", "@language": "de"},
      {"@value": "female",   "@language": "en"}
    ],
    "knows": {"@id": "people/bob"},
    "name": "Alice"
  }, {
    "@id": "graphs/1",
    "@graph": {
      "@id": "people/alice",
      "parent": {
        "@id": "people/bob",
        "name": "Bob"
      }
    }
  }, {
    "@id": "graphs/2",
    "@graph": {
      "@id": "people/bob",
      "sibling": {
        "name": "Mary",
        "sibling": {"@id": "people/bob"}
      }
    }
  }]
}

[{
  "@id": "http://example.com/people/alice",
  "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Alice"}],
  "http://schema.org/gender": [
    {"@value": "weiblich","@language": "de"},
    {"@value": "female","@language": "en"}
  ],
  "http://schema.org/knows": [
    {"@id": "http://example.com/people/bob"}
  ]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.com/graphs/1",
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "http://example.com/people/alice",
    "http://schema.org/parent": [{
      "@id": "http://example.com/people/bob",
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Bob"}]
    }]
  }]
}, {
  "@id": "http://example.com/graphs/2",
  "@graph": [{
    "@id": "http://example.com/people/bob",
    "http://schema.org/sibling": [{
      "http://schema.org/name": [{"@value": "Mary"}],
      "http://schema.org/sibling": [
        {"@id": "http://example.com/people/bob"}
      ]
    }]
  }]
}]

@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .

<http://example.com/people/alice> schema:knows <http://example.com/people/bob>;
  schema:name "Alice";
  schema:gender "weiblich"@de, "female"@en .

<http://example.com/graphs/1> {
  <http://example.com/people/alice> schema:parent <http://example.com/people/bob> .
  <http://example.com/people/bob> schema:name "Bob" .
}

<http://example.com/graphs/2> {
  <http://example.com/people/bob> schema:sibling [
    schema:name "Mary";
    schema:sibling <http://example.com/people/bob>
  ] .
}

Note the use of @graph at the outer-most level to describe three top-level
    resources (two of them named graphs ). The named graphs use @graph in addition
    to @id to provide the name for each graph.


## 9. JSON-LD Grammar

This section restates the syntactic conventions described in the
    previous sections more formally.

A JSON-LD document MUST be valid JSON text as described
    in [ RFC8259 ], or some format that can be represented
      in the JSON-LD internal representation that is equivalent to
      valid JSON text .

A JSON-LD document MUST be a single node object ,
    a map consisting of only
    the entries @context and/or @graph ,
    or an array of zero or more node objects .

In contrast to JSON, in JSON-LD the keys in objects MUST be unique.

Whenever a keyword is discussed in this grammar,
    the statements also apply to an alias for that keyword .

JSON-LD allows keywords to be aliased
    (see § 4.1.6 Aliasing Keywords for details). For example, if the active context defines the term id as an alias for @id ,
    that alias may be legitimately used as a substitution for @id .
    Note that keyword aliases are not expanded during context
    processing.


### 9.1 Terms

A term is a short-hand string that expands
      to an IRI , blank node identifier , or keyword .

A term MUST NOT equal any of the JSON-LD keywords , other than @type .

When used as the prefix in a Compact IRI , to avoid
      the potential ambiguity of a prefix being confused with an IRI scheme, terms SHOULD NOT come from the list of URI schemes as defined in
      [ IANA-URI-SCHEMES ]. Similarly, to avoid confusion between a Compact IRI and a term , terms SHOULD NOT include a colon ( : )
      and SHOULD be restricted to the form of isegment-nz-nc as defined in [ RFC3987 ].

To avoid forward-compatibility issues, a term SHOULD NOT start
      with an @ character followed exclusively by one or more ALPHA characters (see [ RFC5234 ]) as future versions of JSON-LD may introduce
      additional keywords . Furthermore, the term MUST NOT be an empty string ( "" ) as not all programming languages
      are able to handle empty JSON keys.

See § 3.1 The Context and § 3.2 IRIs for further discussion
      on mapping terms to IRIs .


### 9.2 Node Objects

A node object represents zero or more properties of a node in the graph serialized by the JSON-LD document . A map is a node object if it exists outside of a JSON-LD context and:

it is not the top-most map in the JSON-LD document consisting
        of no other entries than @graph and @context ,

it does not contain the @value , @list ,
        or @set keywords, and

it is not a graph object .

The properties of a node in
      a graph may be spread among different node objects within a document. When
      that happens, the keys of the different node objects need to be merged to create the
      properties of the resulting node .

A node object MUST be a map . All keys
      which are not IRIs , compact IRIs , terms valid in the active context , or one of the following keywords (or alias of such a keyword) MUST be ignored when processed:

@context ,

@id ,

@included ,

@graph ,

@nest ,

@type ,

@reverse , or

@index

If the node object contains the @context key, its value MUST be null , an IRI reference ,
      a context definition , or
      an array composed of any of these.

If the node object contains the @id key,
      its value MUST be an IRI reference ,
      or a compact IRI (including blank node identifiers ).
      See § 3.3 Node Identifiers , § 4.1.5 Compact IRIs , and § 4.5.1 Identifying Blank Nodes for further discussion on @id values.

If the node object contains the @graph key, its value MUST be
      a node object or
      an array of zero or more node objects .
      If the node object also contains an @id keyword,
      its value is used as the graph name of a named graph .
      See § 4.9 Named Graphs for further discussion on @graph values. As a special case, if a map contains no keys other than @graph and @context , and the map is the root of the JSON-LD document, the map is not treated as a node object ; this
      is used as a way of defining node objects that may not form a connected graph. This allows a context to be defined which is shared by all of the constituent node objects .

If the node object contains the @type key, its value MUST be either an IRI reference , a compact IRI (including blank node identifiers ),
      a term defined in the active context expanding into an IRI , or
      an array of any of these.
      See § 3.5 Specifying the Type for further discussion on @type values.

If the node object contains the @reverse key,
      its value MUST be a map containing entries representing reverse
      properties. Each value of such a reverse property MUST be an IRI reference ,
      a compact IRI , a blank node identifier ,
      a node object or an array containing a combination of these.

If the node object contains the @included key,
      its value MUST be an included block .
      See § 9.13 Included Blocks for further discussion
      on included blocks .

If the node object contains the @index key,
      its value MUST be a string . See § 4.6.1 Data Indexing for further discussion
      on @index values.

If the node object contains the @nest key,
      its value MUST be a map or an array of map which MUST NOT include a value object . See § 9.14 Property Nesting for further discussion
      on @nest values.

Keys in a node object that are not keywords MAY expand to an IRI using the active context . The values associated with keys that expand
      to an IRI MUST be one of the following:

string ,

number ,

true ,

false ,

null ,

node object ,

graph object ,

value object ,

list object ,

set object ,

an array of zero or more of any of the possibilities above,

a language map ,

an index map ,

an included block

an id map , or

a type map


### 9.3 Frame Objects

When framing , a frame object extends a node object to allow entries used specifically for framing .

A frame object MAY include a default object as the value of any key
        which is not a keyword .
        Values of @default MAY include the value @null ,
        or an array containing only @null , in addition to other values
        allowed in the grammar for values of entry keys expanding to IRIs .

The values of @id and @type MAY additionally be
        an empty map ( wildcard ),
        an array containing only an empty map ,
        an empty array ( match none )
        an array of IRIs .

A frame object MAY include an entry with the key @embed with
        any value from @always , @once , and @never .

A frame object MAY include entries with the boolean valued
        keys @explicit , @omitDefault , or @requireAll

In addition to other property values, a property of a frame object MAY include a value pattern (See § 9.6 Value Patterns ).

See [ JSON-LD11-FRAMING ] for a description of how frame objects are used.


### 9.4 Graph Objects

A graph object represents a named graph , which MAY include
      an explicit graph name .
      A map is a graph object if
      it exists outside of a JSON-LD context ,
      it contains an @graph entry (or an alias of that keyword ),
      it is not the top-most map in the JSON-LD document, and
      it consists of no entries other than @graph , @index , @id and @context , or an alias of one of these keywords .

If the graph object contains the @context key, its value MUST be null , an IRI reference , a context definition , or
      an array composed of any of these.

If the graph object contains the @id key,
      its value is used as the identifier ( graph name ) of a named graph , and MUST be an IRI reference ,
      or a compact IRI (including blank node identifiers ).
      See § 3.3 Node Identifiers , § 4.1.5 Compact IRIs , and § 4.5.1 Identifying Blank Nodes for further discussion on @id values.

A graph object without an @id entry is also a simple graph object and represents a named graph without an
      explicit identifier, although in the data model it still has a graph name , which is an implicitly allocated blank node identifier .

The value of the @graph key MUST be
      a node object or
      an array of zero or more node objects .
      See § 4.9 Named Graphs for further discussion on @graph values..


### 9.5 Value Objects

A value object is used to explicitly associate a type or a
      language with a value to create a typed value or a language-tagged string and possibly associate a base direction .

A value object MUST be a map containing the @value key. It MAY also contain an @type ,
      an @language , an @direction , an @index , or an @context key but MUST NOT contain
      both an @type and either @language or @direction keys at the same time.
      A value object MUST NOT contain any other keys that expand to an IRI or keyword .

The value associated with the @value key MUST be either a string , a number , true , false or null . If the value associated with the @type key is @json , the value MAY be either an array or an object .

The value associated with the @type key MUST be a term ,
      an IRI ,
      a compact IRI ,
      a string which can be turned into an IRI using the vocabulary mapping , @json ,
      or null .

The value associated with the @language key MUST have the lexical form described in [ BCP47 ], or be null .

The value associated with the @direction key MUST be
      one of "ltr" or "rtl" , or be null .

The value associated with the @index key MUST be a string .

See § 4.2.1 Typed Values and § 4.2.4 String Internationalization for more information on value objects .


### 9.6 Value Patterns

When framing ,
      a value pattern extends a value object to allow entries used specifically for framing .

The values of @value , @language , @direction and @type MAY additionally be
        an empty map ( wildcard ),
        an array containing only an empty map ,
        an empty array ( match none ),
        an array of strings .


### 9.7 Lists and Sets

A list represents an ordered set of values. A set
      represents an unordered set of values. Unless otherwise specified, arrays are unordered in JSON-LD. As such, the @set keyword, when used in the body of a JSON-LD document,
      represents just syntactic sugar which is optimized away when processing the document.
      However, it is very helpful when used within the context of a document. Values
      of terms associated with an @set or @list container
      will always be represented in the form of an array when a document
      is processed—even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
      a non-array form in compacted document form .
      This simplifies post-processing of the data as the data is always in a
      deterministic form.

A list object MUST be a map that contains no
      keys that expand to an IRI or keyword other
      than @list and @index .

A set object MUST be a map that contains no
      keys that expand to an IRI or keyword other
      than @set and @index .
      Please note that the @index key will be ignored when being processed.

In both cases, the value associated with the keys @list and @set MUST be one of the following types:

string ,

number ,

true ,

false ,

null ,

node object ,

value object , or

an array of zero or more of the above possibilities

See § 4.3 Value Ordering for further discussion on sets and lists.


### 9.8 Language Maps

A language map is used to associate a language with a value in a
      way that allows easy programmatic access. A language map may be
      used as a term value within a node object if the term is defined
      with @container set to @language , or an array containing both @language and @set . The keys of a language map MUST be strings representing
      [ BCP47 ] language tags, the keyword @none ,
      or a term which expands to @none ,
      and the values MUST be any of the following types:

null ,

string , or

an array of zero or more of the strings

See § 4.2.4 String Internationalization for further discussion
      on language maps.


### 9.9 Index Maps

An index map allows keys that have no semantic meaning,
      but should be preserved regardless, to be used in JSON-LD documents.
      An index map may
      be used as a term value within a node object if the
      term is defined with @container set to @index , or an array containing both @index and @set .
      The values of the entries of an index map MUST be one
      of the following types:

string ,

number ,

true ,

false ,

null ,

node object ,

value object ,

list object ,

set object ,

an array of zero or more of the above possibilities

See § 4.6.1 Data Indexing for further information on this topic.

Index Maps may also be used to map indexes to associated named graphs , if the term is defined with @container set to an array containing both @graph and @index , and optionally including @set . The
      value consists of the node objects contained within the named
      graph which is indexed using the referencing key, which can be
      represented as a simple graph object if the value does
      not include @id , or a named graph if it includes @id .


### 9.10 Property-based Index Maps

A property-based index map is a variant of index map were indexes are semantically preserved in the graph as property values.
      A property-based index map may be used as a term value within a node object if the term is defined with @container set to @index ,
      or an array containing both @index and @set ,
      and with @index set to a string .
      The values of a property-based index map MUST be node objects or strings which expand to node objects .

When expanding,
      if the active context contains a term definition for the value of @index ,
      this term definition will be used to expand the keys of the index map .
      Otherwise, the keys will be expanded as simple value objects .
      Each node object in the expanded values of the index map will be added an additional property value,
      where the property is the expanded value of @index ,
      and the value is the expanded referencing key.

See § 4.6.1.1 Property-based data indexing for further information on this topic.


### 9.11 Id Maps

An id map is used to associate an IRI with a value that allows easy
      programmatic access. An id map may be used as a term value within a node object if the term is defined with @container set to @id ,
      or an array containing both @id and @set .
      The keys of an id map MUST be IRIs ( IRI references or compact IRIs (including blank node identifiers )),
      the keyword @none ,
      or a term which expands to @none ,
      and the values MUST be node objects .

If the value contains a property expanding to @id , its value MUST be equivalent to the referencing key. Otherwise, the property from the value is used as
      the @id of the node object value when expanding.

Id Maps may also be used to map graph names to their named graphs , if the term is defined with @container set to an array containing both @graph and @id ,
      and optionally including @set . The value consists of the node objects contained within the named graph which is named using the referencing key.


### 9.12 Type Maps

A type map is used to associate an IRI with a value that allows easy
      programmatic access. A type map may be used as a term value within a node object if the term is defined with @container set to @type ,
      or an array containing both @type and @set .
      The keys of a type map MUST be IRIs ( IRI references or compact IRI (including blank node identifiers )), terms ,
      or the keyword @none ,
      and the values MUST be node objects or strings which expand to node objects .

If the value contains a property expanding to @type , and its value
      is contains the referencing key after suitable expansion of both the referencing key
      and the value, then the node object already contains the type. Otherwise, the property from the value is
      added as a @type of the node object value when expanding.


### 9.13 Included Blocks

An included block is used to provide a set of node objects .
      An included block MAY appear as the value of a member of a node object with either the key of @included or an alias of @included .
      An included block is either a node object or an array of node objects .

When expanding , multiple included blocks will be coalesced into a single included block .


### 9.14 Property Nesting

A nested property is used to gather properties of a node object in a separate map , or array of maps which are not value objects . It is semantically transparent and is removed
      during the process of expansion . Property nesting is recursive, and
      collections of nested properties may contain further nesting.

Semantically, nesting is treated as if the properties and values were declared directly
      within the containing node object .


### 9.15 Context Definitions

A context definition defines a local context in a node object .

A context definition MUST be a map whose
    keys MUST be either terms , compact IRIs , IRIs ,
    or one of the keywords @base , @import , @language , @propagate , @protected , @type , @version ,
    or @vocab .

If the context definition has an @base key,
    its value MUST be an IRI reference ,
    or null .

If the context definition has an @direction key,
    its value MUST be one of "ltr" or "rtl" , or be null .

If the context definition contains the @import keyword , its value MUST be an IRI reference .
  When used as a reference from an @import , the referenced context definition MUST NOT include an @import key, itself.

If the context definition has an @language key,
    its value MUST have the lexical form described in [ BCP47 ] or be null .

If the context definition has an @propagate key,
    its value MUST be true or false .

If the context definition has an @protected key,
    its value MUST be true or false .

If the context definition has an @type key,
    its value MUST be a map with only the entry @container set to @set ,
    and optionally an entry @protected .

If the context definition has an @version key,
    its value MUST be a number with the value 1.1 .

If the context definition has an @vocab key,
    its value MUST be an IRI reference , a compact IRI ,
    a blank node identifier ,
    a term , or null .

The value of keys that are not keywords MUST be either an IRI , a compact IRI , a term ,
    a blank node identifier , a keyword , null ,
    or an expanded term definition .


#### 9.15.1 Expanded term definition

An expanded term definition is used to describe the mapping
    between a term and its expanded identifier, as well as other
    properties of the value associated with the term when it is
    used as key in a node object .

An expanded term definition MUST be a map composed of zero or more keys from @id , @reverse , @type , @language , @container , @context , @prefix , @propagate , or @protected .
      An expanded term definition SHOULD NOT contain any other keys.

When the associated term is @type , the expanded term definition MUST NOT contain keys other than @container and @protected .
      The value of @container is limited to the single value @set .

If the term being defined is not an IRI or a compact IRI and the active context does not have an @vocab mapping, the expanded term definition MUST include the @id key.

Term definitions with keys which are of the form of an IRI or a compact IRI MUST NOT expand to an IRI other than the expansion of the key itself.

If the expanded term definition contains the @id keyword , its value MUST be null , an IRI ,
      a blank node identifier , a compact IRI , a term ,
      or a keyword .

If an expanded term definition has an @reverse entry ,
      it MUST NOT have @id or @nest entries at the same time,
      its value MUST be an IRI ,
      a blank node identifier , a compact IRI , or a term . If an @container entry exists, its value MUST be null , @set , or @index .

If the expanded term definition contains the @type keyword , its value MUST be an IRI , a compact IRI , a term , null , or one of the keywords @id , @json , @none , or @vocab .

If the expanded term definition contains the @language keyword ,
      its value MUST have the lexical form described in [ BCP47 ] or be null .

If the expanded term definition contains the @index keyword , its value MUST be an IRI ,
      a compact IRI , or a term .

If the expanded term definition contains the @container keyword , its value MUST be either @list , @set , @language , @index , @id , @graph , @type , or be null or an array containing exactly any one of those keywords, or a
        combination of @set and any of @index , @id , @graph , @type , @language in any order . @container may also be an array
        containing @graph along with either @id or @index and also optionally including @set . If the value
      is @language , when the term is used outside of the @context , the associated value MUST be a language map .
      If the value is @index , when the term is used outside of
      the @context , the associated value MUST be an index map .

If an expanded term definition has an @context entry ,
      it MUST be a valid context definition .

If the expanded term definition contains the @nest keyword , its value MUST be either @nest , or a term
      which expands to @nest .

If the expanded term definition contains the @prefix keyword , its value MUST be true or false .

If the expanded term definition contains the @propagate keyword , its value MUST be true or false .

If the expanded term definition contains the @protected keyword , its value MUST be true or false .

Terms MUST NOT be used in a circular manner. That is,
      the definition of a term cannot depend on the definition of another term if that other
      term also depends on the first term.

See § 3.1 The Context for further discussion on contexts .


### 9.16 Keywords

JSON-LD keywords are described in § 1.7 Syntax Tokens and Keywords ,
    this section describes where each keyword may appear within different JSON-LD structures.

Within node objects , value objects , graph objects , list objects , set objects , and nested properties keyword aliases MAY be used instead of the corresponding keyword , except for @context .
    The @context keyword MUST NOT be aliased.
    Within local contexts and expanded term definitions , keyword aliases MAY NOT used.

The unaliased @type MAY be used as a key in an expanded term definition ,
        where its value may also be either @id or @vocab ,
        or as the value of the @container key within an expanded term definition .

Within a context, @type may be used as the key for an expanded term definition ,
        whose entries are limited to @container and @protected .

This keyword is described further in § 3.5 Specifying the Type and § 4.2.1 Typed Values .


## 10. Relationship to RDF

JSON-LD is a concrete RDF syntax as described in [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ]. Hence, a JSON-LD document is both an
    RDF document and a JSON document and correspondingly represents an
    instance of an RDF data model . However, JSON-LD also extends the RDF data
    model to optionally allow JSON-LD to serialize generalized RDF Datasets .
    The JSON-LD extensions to the RDF data model are:

In JSON-LD properties can be IRIs or blank nodes whereas in RDF properties ( predicates ) have to be IRIs . This
      means that JSON-LD serializes generalized RDF Datasets .

In JSON-LD lists use native JSON syntax, either contained in a
      list object, or described as such within a context. Consequently, developers
      using the JSON representation can access list elements directly rather than
      using the vocabulary for collections described in [ RDF-SCHEMA ].

RDF values are either typed literals ( typed values ) or language-tagged strings whereas
      JSON-LD also supports JSON's native data types, i.e., number , strings , and the boolean values true and false . The JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ]
      defines the conversion rules between JSON's native data types and RDF's counterparts to allow round-tripping.

As an extension to the RDF data model ,
      literals without an explicit datatype MAY include a base direction .
      As there is currently no standardized mechanism for representing the base direction of RDF literals , the JSON-LD to standard RDF transformation loses the base direction.
      However, the Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF Algorithm provides a means of representing base direction using mechanisms which will preserve round-tripping through non-standard RDF.

The use of blank node identifiers to label properties is obsolete,
    and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD, as is the support for generalized RDF Datasets .

Summarized, these differences mean that JSON-LD is capable of serializing any RDF graph or dataset and most, but not all, JSON-LD documents can be directly
    interpreted as RDF as described in RDF 1.1 Concepts [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ].

Authors are strongly encouraged to avoid labeling properties using blank node identifiers ,
    instead, consider one of the following mechanisms:

a relative IRI reference , either relative to the document or the vocabulary
      (see § 4.1.4 Using the Document Base for the Default Vocabulary for a discussion on using the document base as part of the vocabulary mapping ),

a URN such as urn:example:1 , see [ URN ], or

a "Skolem IRI " as per Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs of [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ].

The normative algorithms for interpreting JSON-LD as RDF and serializing
    RDF as JSON-LD are specified in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API
    specification [ JSON-LD11-API ].

Even though JSON-LD serializes RDF Datasets , it can
    also be used as a graph source .
    In that case, a consumer MUST only use the default graph and ignore all named graphs .
    This allows servers to expose data in languages such as Turtle and JSON-LD
    using HTTP content negotiation .

Publishers supporting both dataset and graph syntaxes have to ensure that
    the primary data is stored in the default graph to enable consumers that do not support datasets to process the information.


### 10.1 Serializing/Deserializing RDF

This section is non-normative.

The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD and deserializing JSON-LD to RDF
      depends on executing the algorithms defined in RDF Serialization-Deserialization Algorithms in the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ].
      It is beyond the scope of this document to detail these algorithms any further,
      but a summary of the necessary operations is provided to illustrate the process.

The procedure to deserialize a JSON-LD document to RDF involves the
      following steps:

Expand the JSON-LD document, removing any context; this ensures
        that properties, types, and values are given their full representation
        as IRIs and expanded values. Expansion is discussed further in § 5.1 Expanded Document Form .

Flatten the document, which turns the document into an array of node objects . Flattening is discussed
        further in § 5.3 Flattened Document Form .

Turn each node object into a series of triples .

For example, consider the following JSON-LD document in compact form:

{ "@context" : { "name" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" , "knows" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows" }, "@id" : "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/" , "name" : "Markus Lanthaler" , "knows" : [
    { "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" , "name" : "Manu Sporny" }, { "name" : "Dave Longley" }
  ]
}

Running the JSON-LD Expansion and Flattening algorithms against the
      JSON-LD input document in the example above would result in the
      following output:

[
  { "@id" : "_:b0" , "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" : "Dave Longley" }, { "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" , "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" : "Manu Sporny" }, { "@id" : "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/" , "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" : "Markus Lanthaler" , "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows" : [
      { "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" },
      { "@id" : "_:b0" }
    ]
  }
]

Deserializing this to RDF now is a straightforward process of turning
      each node object into one or more triples . This can be
      expressed in Turtle as follows:

@prefix foaf: < http: // xmlns.com / foaf / 0.1 /> .

_:b0 foaf:name "Dave Longley" .

<http: //manu.sporny.org/about#manu> foaf:name "Manu Sporny" . < http: // me.markus-lanthaler.com /> foaf:name "Markus Lanthaler" ;
    foaf:knows <http: //manu.sporny.org/about#manu>, _:b0 .

The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD can be thought of as the
      inverse of this last step, creating an expanded JSON-LD document closely
      matching the triples from RDF, using a single node object for all triples having a common subject, and a single property for those triples also having a common predicate . The result may
      then be framed by using the Framing Algorithm described in [ JSON-LD11-FRAMING ] to create the desired object embedding.


### 10.2 The rdf:JSON Datatype

RDF provides for JSON content as a possible literal value .
      This allows markup in literal values.
      Such content is indicated in a graph using a literal whose datatype is set to rdf:JSON .

The rdf:JSON datatype is defined as follows:

It MUST NOT contain any unnecessary whitespace,

Keys in objects MUST be ordered lexicographically,

Native Numeric values MUST be serialized according to Section 7.1.12.1 of [ ECMASCRIPT ],

Strings MUST be serialized with Unicode codepoints from U+0000 through U+001F using lower case hexadecimal Unicode notation ( \uhhhh ) unless in the set
            of predefined JSON control characters U+0008 , U+0009 , U+000A , U+000C or U+000D which SHOULD be serialized as \b , \t , \n , \f and \r respectively.
            All other Unicode characters SHOULD be serialized "as is", other than U+005C ( \ ) and U+0022 ( " )
            which SHOULD be serialized as \\ and \" respectively.

parsing it into
            an internal representation consistent with [ ECMASCRIPT ] representation
            created by using the JSON.parse function as defined in Section 24.5 The JSON Object of [ ECMASCRIPT ],

then serializing it in the JSON format [ RFC8259 ]
            in compliance with the constraints of the value space described above.


### 10.3 The i18n Namespace

This section is non-normative.

The i18n namespace is used for describing combinations of language tag and base direction in RDF literals .
      It is used as an alternative mechanism for describing the [ BCP47 ] language tag and base direction of RDF literals that would otherwise use the xsd:string or rdf:langString datatypes.

Datatypes based on this namespace allow round-tripping of JSON-LD documents using base direction,
      although the mechanism is not otherwise standardized.

The Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF Algorithm can be used with the rdfDirection option
      set to i18n-datatype to generate RDF literals using the i18n base to create an IRI encoding the base direction along with optional language tag (normalized to lower case)
      from value objects containing @direction by appending to https://www.w3.org/ns/i18n# the value of @language , if any, followed by an underscore ( "_" ) followed
      by the value of @direction .

For improved interoperability, the language tag is normalized to
      lower case when creating the datatype IRI .

The following example shows two statements with literal values of i18n:ar-EG_rtl ,
      which encodes the language tag ar-EG and the base direction rtl .

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
@prefix i18n: <https://www.w3.org/ns/i18n#> .

# Note that this version preserves the base direction using a non-standard datatype.
[
  ex:title "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب"^^i18n:ar-eg_rtl ;
  ex:publisher "مكتبة"^^i18n:ar-eg_rtl ] .

See § 4.2.4.1 Base Direction for more details
      on using base direction for strings.


### 10.4 The rdf:CompoundLiteral class and the rdf:language and rdf:direction properties

This section is non-normative.

This specification defines the rdf:CompoundLiteral class, which is in the domain
      of rdf:language and rdf:direction to be used for describing RDF literal values
      containing base direction and a possible language tag to be associated with the
      string value of rdf:value on the same subject.

The Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF Algorithm can be used with the rdfDirection option
      set to compound-literal to generate RDF literals using these properties to
      describe the base direction and optional language tag (normalized to lower case)
      from value objects containing @direction and optionally @language .

For improved interoperability, the language tag is normalized to
      lower case when creating the datatype IRI .

The following example shows two statements with compound literals
      representing strings with the language tag ar-EG and base direction rtl .

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

# Note that this version preserves the base direction using a bnode structure.
[
  ex:title [
    rdf:value "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
    rdf:language "ar-eg",
    rdf:direction "rtl"
  ] ;
  ex:publisher [
    rdf:value "مكتبة",
    rdf:language "ar-eg",
    rdf:direction "rtl"
  ] ] .

See § 4.2.4.1 Base Direction for more details
      on using base direction for strings.


## 11. Security Considerations

See, Security Considerations in § C. IANA Considerations .

Future versions of this specification
    may incorporate subresource integrity [ SRI ] as a means of ensuring that cached and retrieved
    content matches data retrieved from remote servers; see issue 86 .


## 12. Privacy Considerations

The retrieval of external contexts can expose the operation of a JSON-LD processor,
    allow intermediate nodes to fingerprint the client application through introspection of retrieved resources
    (see [ fingerprinting-guidance ]),
    and provide an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack.
    To protect against this, publishers should consider caching remote contexts for future use,
    or use the documentLoader to maintain a local version of such contexts.


## 13. Internationalization Considerations

As JSON-LD uses the RDF data model, it is restricted by design in its ability to
    properly record JSON-LD Values which are strings with left-to-right or right-to-left direction indicators.
    Both JSON-LD and RDF provide a mechanism for specifying the language associated with
    a string ( language-tagged string ), but do not provide a means of indicating
    the base direction of the string.

Unicode provides a mechanism for signaling direction within a string
    (see Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [ UAX9 ]),
    however, when a string has an overall base direction which cannot be determined by the
    beginning of the string, an external indicator is required,
    such as the [ HTML ] dir attribute ,
    which currently has no counterpart for RDF literals .

The issue of properly representing base direction in RDF is not something that
    this Working Group can handle, as it is a limitation or the core RDF data model.
    This Working Group expects that a future RDF Working Group will consider the matter
    and add the ability to specify the base direction of language-tagged strings .

Until a more comprehensive solution can be addressed in a future version of this
    specification, publishers should consider this issue when representing strings
    where the base direction of the string cannot otherwise be correctly inferred
    based on the content of the string.
    See [ string-meta ] for a discussion best practices for
    identifying language and base direction for strings used on the Web.


## A. Image Descriptions

This section is non-normative.


### A.1 Linked Data Dataset

This section is non-normative.

This section describes the Linked Data Dataset figure in § 8. Data Model .

The image consists of three dashed boxes, each describing a different linked data graph . Each box consists of shapes linked with arrows describing
        the linked data relationships.

The first box is titled "default graph: <no name>" describes two
        resources: http://example.com/people/alice and http://example.com/people/bob (denoting "Alice" and "Bob" respectively), which are
        connected by an arrow labeled schema:knows which describes
        the knows relationship between the two resources. Additionally, the "Alice" resource is related
        to three different literals:

The second and third boxes describe two named graphs , with the graph names
        "http://example.com/graphs/1" and "http://example.com/graphs/1", respectively.

The second box consists of two resources: http://example.com/people/alice and http://example.com/people/bob related by the schema:parent relationship, and names the http://example.com/people/bob "Bob".

The third box consists of two resources, one
        named http://example.com/people/bob and the other unnamed.
        The two resources related to each other using schema:sibling relationship
        with the second named "Mary".


## B. Relationship to Other Linked Data Formats

This section is non-normative.

The JSON-LD examples below demonstrate how JSON-LD can be used to
    express semantic data marked up in other linked data formats such as Turtle,
    RDFa, and Microdata. These sections are merely provided as
    evidence that JSON-LD is very flexible in what it can express across different
    Linked Data approaches.


### B.1 Turtle

This section is non-normative.

The following are examples of transforming RDF expressed in [ Turtle ]
      into JSON-LD.


#### B.1.1 Prefix definitions

The JSON-LD context has direct equivalents for the Turtle @prefix declaration:

@prefix foaf: < http: // xmlns.com / foaf / 0.1 /> .

<http: //manu.sporny.org/about#manu> a foaf:Person; foaf:name "Manu Sporny" ;
  foaf:homepage <http: //manu.sporny.org/> .

{ "@context" : { "foaf" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" }, "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" , "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:name" : "Manu Sporny" , "foaf:homepage" : { "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/" }
}


#### B.1.2 Embedding

Both [ Turtle ] and JSON-LD allow embedding, although [ Turtle ] only allows embedding of blank nodes .

@prefix foaf: < http: //xmlns.com/foaf/ 0.1 /> .

< http: //manu.sporny.org/about#manu>
  a foaf: Person; foaf :name " Manu Sporny "; foaf :knows [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name "Gregg Kellogg" ] .

{ "@context" : { "foaf" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" }, "@id" : "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" , "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:name" : "Manu Sporny" , "foaf:knows" : { "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:name" : "Gregg Kellogg" }
}


#### B.1.3 Conversion of native data types

In JSON-LD numbers and boolean values are native data types. While [ Turtle ]
        has a shorthand syntax to express such values, RDF's abstract syntax requires
        that numbers and boolean values are represented as typed literals. Thus,
        to allow full round-tripping, the JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ]
        defines conversion rules between JSON-LD's native data types and RDF's
        counterparts. Numbers without fractions are
        converted to xsd:integer -typed literals, numbers with fractions
        to xsd:double -typed literals and the two boolean values true and false to a xsd:boolean -typed
        literal. All typed literals are in canonical lexical form.

{ "@context" : { "ex" : "http://example.com/vocab#" }, "@id" : "http://example.com/" , "ex:numbers" : [ 14 , 2.78 ], "ex:booleans" : [ true , false ]
}

@prefix ex: < http: //example.com/vocab#> .
@prefix xsd: < http: //www.w3.org/ 2001 /XMLSchema#> .

< http: //example.com/> ex: numbers "14" ^^ xsd: integer, "2.78E0" ^^ xsd: double ; ex :booleans " true "^^ xsd :boolean , " false "^^ xsd :boolean .


#### B.1.4 Lists

Both JSON-LD and [ Turtle ] can represent sequential lists of values.

@prefix foaf: < http: //xmlns.com/foaf/ 0.1 /> .

< http: //example.org/people#joebob> a foaf: Person; foaf :name " Joe Bob "; foaf :nick ( " joe " " bob " " jaybee " ) .

{ "@context" : { "foaf" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" }, "@id" : "http://example.org/people#joebob" , "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:name" : "Joe Bob" , "foaf:nick" : { "@list" : [ "joe" , "bob" , "jaybee" ]
  }
}


### B.2 RDFa

This section is non-normative.

The following example describes three people with their respective names and
      homepages in RDFa [ RDFA-CORE ].

<div prefix="foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" >
   <ul>
      <li typeof="foaf:Person" >
        <a property="foaf:homepage" href="http://example.com/bob/">
          <span property="foaf:name" >Bob</span>
        </a>
      </li>
      <li typeof="foaf:Person" >
        <a property="foaf:homepage" href="http://example.com/eve/">
         <span property="foaf:name" >Eve</span>
        </a>
      </li>
      <li typeof="foaf:Person" >
        <a property="foaf:homepage" href="http://example.com/manu/">
          <span property="foaf:name" >Manu</span>
        </a>
      </li>
   </ul>
</div>

An example JSON-LD implementation using a single context is
      described below.

{ "@context" : { "foaf" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" , "foaf:homepage" : { "@type" : "@id" }
  }, "@graph" : [
    { "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:homepage" : "http://example.com/bob/" , "foaf:name" : "Bob" }, { "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:homepage" : "http://example.com/eve/" , "foaf:name" : "Eve" }, { "@type" : "foaf:Person" , "foaf:homepage" : "http://example.com/manu/" , "foaf:name" : "Manu" }
  ]
}


### B.3 Microdata

This section is non-normative.

The HTML Microdata [ MICRODATA ] example below expresses book information as
      a Microdata Work item.

< dl itemscope itemtype = "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Work" itemid = "http://purl.oreilly.com/works/45U8QJGZSQKDH8N" > < dt > Title </ dt > < dd > < cite itemprop = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title" > Just a Geek </ cite > </ dd > < dt > By </ dt > < dd > < span itemprop = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator" > Wil Wheaton </ span > </ dd > < dt > Format </ dt > < dd itemprop = "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#realization" itemscope itemtype = "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Expression" itemid = "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596007683.BOOK" > < link itemprop = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type" href = "http://purl.oreilly.com/product-types/BOOK" > Print </ dd > < dd itemprop = "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#realization" itemscope itemtype = "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Expression" itemid = "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596802189.EBOOK" > < link itemprop = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type" href = "http://purl.oreilly.com/product-types/EBOOK" > Ebook </ dd > </ dl >

Note that the JSON-LD representation of the Microdata information stays
      true to the desires of the Microdata community to avoid contexts and
      instead refer to items by their full IRI .

[
  { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/works/45U8QJGZSQKDH8N" , "@type" : "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Work" , "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title" : "Just a Geek" , "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator" : "Wil Wheaton" , "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#realization" :
    [
      { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596007683.BOOK" },
      { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596802189.EBOOK" }
    ]
  }, { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596007683.BOOK" , "@type" : "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Expression" , "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type" : { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/product-types/BOOK" }
  }, { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/products/9780596802189.EBOOK" , "@type" : "http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Expression" , "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type" : { "@id" : "http://purl.oreilly.com/product-types/EBOOK" }
  }
]


## C. IANA Considerations

This section has been submitted to the Internet Engineering Steering
    Group (IESG) for review, approval, and registration with IANA.


### application/ld+json

A non-empty list of space-separated URIs identifying specific
            constraints or conventions that apply to a JSON-LD document according to [ RFC6906 ].
            A profile does not change the semantics of the resource representation
            when processed without profile knowledge, so that clients both with
            and without knowledge of a profiled resource can safely use the same
            representation. The profile parameter MAY be used by
            clients to express their preferences in the content negotiation process.
            If the profile parameter is given, a server SHOULD return a document that
            honors the profiles in the list which it recognizes,
            and MUST ignore the profiles in the list which it does not recognize.
            It is RECOMMENDED that profile URIs are dereferenceable and provide
            useful documentation at that URI. For more information and background
            please refer to [ RFC6906 ].

This specification defines six values for the profile parameter.

All other URIs starting with http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld are reserved for future use by JSON-LD specifications.

Other specifications may publish additional profile parameter
            URIs with their own defined semantics.
            This includes the ability to associate a file extension with a profile parameter.

When used as a media type parameter [ RFC4288 ]
            in an HTTP Accept header [ RFC7231 ],
            the value of the profile parameter MUST be enclosed in quotes ( " ) if it contains
            special characters such as whitespace, which is required when multiple profile URIs are combined.

When processing the "profile" media type parameter, it is important to
            note that its value contains one or more URIs and not IRIs. In some cases
            it might therefore be necessary to convert between IRIs and URIs as specified in section 3 Relationship between IRIs and URIs of [ RFC3987 ].

Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for
        directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a
        code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's eval() function to be parsed. An (invalid) document may contain code that,
        when executed, could lead to unexpected side effects compromising
        the security of a system.

When processing JSON-LD documents, links to remote contexts and frames are
        typically followed automatically, resulting in the transfer of files
        without the explicit request of the user for each one. If remote
        contexts are served by third parties, it may allow them to gather
        usage patterns or similar information leading to privacy concerns.
        Specific implementations, such as the API defined in the
        JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API specification [ JSON-LD11-API ],
        may provide fine-grained mechanisms to control this behavior.

JSON-LD contexts that are loaded from the Web over non-secure connections,
        such as HTTP, run the risk of being altered by an attacker such that
        they may modify the JSON-LD active context in a way that
        could compromise security. It is advised that any application that
        depends on a remote context for mission critical purposes vet and
        cache the remote context before allowing the system to use it.

Given that JSON-LD allows the substitution of long IRIs with short terms,
        JSON-LD documents may expand considerably when processed and, in the worst case,
        the resulting data might consume all of the recipient's resources. Applications
        should treat any data with due skepticism.

As JSON-LD places no limits on the IRI schemes that may be used,
        and vocabulary-relative IRIs use string concatenation rather than IRI resolution, it is possible to construct IRIs that may be
        used maliciously, if dereferenced.

Fragment identifiers used with application/ld+json are treated as in RDF syntaxes, as per RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax [ RDF11-CONCEPTS ].

This registration is an update to the original definition
    for application/ld+json in [ JSON-LD10 ].


### C.1 Examples

This section is non-normative.

The following examples illustrate different ways in which the profile parameter may be used
      to describe different acceptable responses.

GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com Accept : application/ld+json; profile=http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded

Requests the server to return the requested resource as JSON-LD
      in expanded document form .

GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com Accept : application/ld+json; profile=http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted

Requests the server to return the requested resource as JSON-LD
      in compacted document form .
      As no explicit context resource is specified, the server compacts
      using an application-specific default context.

GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com Accept : application/ld+json; profile="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted"

Requests the server to return the requested resource as JSON-LD
      in both compacted document form and flattened document form .
      Note that as whitespace is used to separate the two URIs, they
      are enclosed in double quotes ( " ).


## D. Open Issues

This section is non-normative.

The following is a list of issues open at the time of publication.

Consider context by reference with metadata.

Compact IRI expansion support for non-trivial prefix term definitions.

Language-maps don't allow separate base direction.

@default in @context in JSON-LD core syntax.

Suggestion about @prefix .

Type Coercion / Node Conversion: @coerce keyword or similar.


## E. Changes since 1.0 Recommendation of 16 January 2014

This section is non-normative.

A context may contain a @version entry which is used to set the processing mode .

An expanded term definition can now have an @context property, which defines a context used for values of
      a property identified with such a term .

@container values within an expanded term definition may now
      include @id , @graph and @type , corresponding to id maps and type maps .

An expanded term definition can now have an @nest property, which identifies a term expanding to @nest which is used for containing properties using the same @nest mapping. When expanding, the values of a property
      expanding to @nest are treated as if they were contained
      within the enclosing node object directly.

The JSON syntax has been abstracted into an internal representation to allow for other serializations that are functionally equivalent
      to JSON.

Added § 4.6.3 Node Identifier Indexing and § 4.6.4 Node Type Indexing .

Both language maps and index maps may legitimately have an @none key, but JSON-LD 1.0 only allowed string keys. This has been updated
      to allow @none keys.

The value for @container in an expanded term definition can also be an array containing any appropriate container
      keyword along with @set (other than @list ).
      This allows a way to ensure that such property values will always
      be expressed in array form.

In JSON-LD 1.1, terms will be chosen as compact IRI prefixes
      when compacting only if
      a simple term definition is used where the value ends with a URI gen-delim character,
      or if their expanded term definition contains
      a @prefix entry with the value true . The 1.0 algorithm has
      been updated to only consider terms that map to a value that ends with a URI gen-delim character.

Values of properties where the associated term definition has @container set to @graph are interpreted as implicitly named graphs , where the associated graph name is
      assigned from a new blank node identifier . Other combinations
      include ["@container", "@id"] , ["@container", "@index"] each also
      may include "@set" , which create maps from the
      graph identifier or index value similar to index maps and id maps .

Additionally, see § F. Changes since JSON-LD Community Group Final Report .


## F. Changes since JSON-LD Community Group Final Report

This section is non-normative.

Lists may now have items which are themselves lists .

Values of @type , or an alias of @type , may now have their @container set to @set to ensure that @type entries are always represented as an array. This
      also allows a term to be defined for @type , where the value MUST be a map with @container set to @set .

The use of blank node identifiers to label properties is obsolete,
      and may be removed in a future version of JSON-LD, as is the support for generalized RDF Datasets .

The vocabulary mapping can be a relative IRI reference , which is evaluated
      either against an existing default vocabulary, or against the document base.
      This allows vocabulary-relative IRIs, such as the
      keys of node objects , are expanded or compacted relative
      to the document base.
      (See Security Considerations in § C. IANA Considerations for a discussion on how string vocabulary-relative IRI resolution via concatenation.
      )

Added support for "@type": "@none" in a term definition to prevent value compaction.
      Define the rdf:JSON datatype.

Term definitions with keys which are of the form of an IRI reference or a compact IRI MUST NOT expand to an IRI other than the expansion of the key itself.

A frame may also be located within an HTML document, identified
      using type application/ld+json;profile=http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#frame .

Term definitions can now be protected ,
      to limit the ability of other contexts to override them.

A context defined in an expanded term definition may also be used for values
      of @type , which defines a context to use for node objects including the associated type.

By default, all contexts are propagated when traversing node objects , other than type-scoped contexts . This can be controlled using the @propagate entry in a local context .

A context may contain an @import entry used to reference a remote context
      within a context, allowing JSON-LD 1.1 features to be added to contexts originally
      authored for JSON-LD 1.0 .

A node object may include an included block ,
      which is used to contain a set of node objects which are treated
      exactly as if they were node objects defined in an array including the containing node object .
      This allows the use of the object form of a JSON-LD document when there is more
      than one node object being defined, and where those node objects are not embedded as values of the containing node object .

The alternate link relation can be used to supply an alternate location for
      retrieving a JSON-LD document when the returned document is not JSON.

Value objects , and associated context and term definitions have been updated to 
      support @direction for setting the base direction of strings.

The processing mode is now implicitly json-ld-1.1 , unless set
      explicitly to json-ld-1.0 .

Improve notation using IRI , IRI reference , and relative IRI reference .

Warn about forward-compatibility issues for terms of the form ( "@"1*ALPHA ).

When creating an i18n datatype or rdf:CompoundLiteral , language tags are
      normalized to lower case to improve interoperability between implementations.


## G. Changes since Candidate Release of 12 December 2019

This section is non-normative.

Expand § 4.1.5 Compact IRIs to describe the behavior
      of "@prefix": false for compact IRIs , and to note that this affects both expansion
      of compact IRIs and compaction of IRIs to compact IRIs .
