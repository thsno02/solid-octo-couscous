# Context

Added in **ODCS v3.2.0** (RFC-0038). The `context` block provides structured, human- and machine-readable guidance for AI agents, LLMs, BI tools, and semantic layer platforms. It is optional and additive.

In ODCS, `context` is applicable at two levels:

- **Data contract (top level)** — overall AI context for the contract: domain, purpose, known limitations.
- **Schema object** — guidance on how to use a specific table or API object: join hints, cardinality notes, time-range guidance.

The `context` block may also be provided as a plain string, equivalent to providing only `instructions`.

## Examples

### Contract level

```yaml
context:
  instructions: >
    This contract governs the turnover dataset for the EMEA sales domain.
    Use it for revenue analysis, order volume trends, and basket value
    benchmarking. Do not use it for individual customer PII queries.
  verifiedStatements:
    - question: "What was total revenue in France last quarter?"
    - id: revenue-last-year
      question: "What was the total revenue last year?"
      answer: "Query ${total_turnover_euros} grouped by year using ${turnover_ts_dim}."
  constraints:
    - id: no-individual-order-exposure
      constraint: "Do not expose individual order details; aggregate to at least country level."
      tags: ['gdpr', 'pii']
      authoritativeDefinitions:
        - url: https://example.com/MyGlobalAndMarvelousOntology
          type: Ontology
          description: Link to the ontology
        - url: https://example.com/MySpecificAndWonderfulGlossary
          type: Glossary
          description: Link to the glossary
        - url: https://example.com/OneOfManyTaxonomy
          type: Taxonomy
          description: Link to the taxonomy
    - constraint: "Do not join with customer PII tables without explicit data access approval."
```

### Schema object level

```yaml
schema:
  - name: turnover
    physicalName: metrics_turnover
    context:
      instructions: >
        This table contains pre-aggregated turnover metrics at order granularity.
        Always filter by turnover_ts when querying time ranges.
      verifiedStatements:
        - question: "What is the total revenue for Germany in Q1 2025?"
      constraints:
        - constraint: "Do not query without a date range filter; the table is unbounded."
```
