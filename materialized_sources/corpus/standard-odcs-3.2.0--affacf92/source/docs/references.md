# References

This section describes how to reference elements within a data contract schema. References enable you to create relationships between different parts of your data contract. This section is new in ODCS v3.1.0.

!!! info

    References are currently only supported for foreign key relationships.

## Fully Qualified Reference Notation

ODCS uses a fully qualified notation with the `id` field and slash-separated paths for stable, refactor-safe references.

**Format:** `<section>/<id>[/properties/<property_id>]`

**Characteristics:**
- Uses the `id` field (optional, recommended for references)
- Slash-separated path
- Stable across renames and refactoring
- Resilient to array reordering
- Explicit and unambiguous

**When to use:**
- Long-lived production contracts
- Complex contracts with many references
- When refactoring is expected
- Cross-contract references

### Allowed characters in an `id`

An `id` cannot contain any of the following characters:

```text
. # / \ @ ! % & ^
```

Whitespace is not allowed either. Every other character is legal, including `:`, so namespaced
identifiers such as `fdir:ISU:TAD` or `urn:uuid:0f6d2c11-4a7e-4a1d-9b3f-8c5e2a7d1b40` are valid ids
and may appear in a fully qualified reference.

The three structural characters are denied for a reason: `.` separates the segments of a shorthand
reference (`table_name.column_name`, see
[Reference Notation for Foreign Keys](#reference-notation-for-foreign-keys)), `/` separates the
segments of a fully qualified reference, and `#` marks entry into an external contract file.
Allowing them inside an id would make a reference ambiguous to parse.

## Reference Structure

A fully formatted reference follows this structure:

```yaml
<file><anchor><item-path-within-contract>
```

Where:

* **`<file>`**: Path to the contract file (optional for same-contract references)
* **`<anchor>`**: '#' symbol to mark entry into a contract (optional for same-contract)
* **`<item-path-within-contract>`**: The fully qualified path within the contract

## External Contract References

To identify a contract, use one of these formats:

```yaml
# Same folder as current contract
data-contract-v1.yaml

# Full path
file:///path/to/data-contract-v1.yaml

# URL
https://example.com/data-contract-v1.yaml

# Relative path
../../path/to/data-contract-v1.yaml
```

## Reference Examples

### Same Contract References

```yaml
# Reference to a schema object
'schema/customers_tbl'

# Reference to a property
'schema/customers_tbl/properties/cust_id_pk'

# Reference to a nested property
'schema/accounts_tbl/properties/address_field/properties/street_field'
```

When referencing elements within the same contract, the file component can be omitted.

### External Contract References

```yaml
# Reference to an element in an external contract
'customer-contract.yaml#/schema/customers_tbl/properties/cust_id_pk'

# Reference to a nested property in an external contract
'external-contract.yaml#/schema/accounts_tbl/properties/address_field/properties/street_field'
```

## Relationships between properties (Foreign Keys)

Properties can define relationships to other properties, enabling you to specify foreign key constraints and other data relationships.

### Quick Overview

Relationships can be defined in two ways:

1. **At the property level** - Define relationships directly on a property (the `from` field is implicit and must NOT be specified)
2. **At the schema level** - Define relationships between any properties (both `from` and `to` are required)

### Important Rules

* **Property-level relationships**: The `from` field is implicit (derived from the property context) and must NOT be specified
* **Schema-level relationships**: Both `from` and `to` fields are required
* **Type consistency**: Both `from` and `to` must be the same type - either both strings (single column) or both arrays (composite keys). Mixing types is not allowed
* **Array length validation**: When using arrays for composite keys, both arrays must have the same number of elements. This is validated at runtime by implementations

### Field Definitions

| Key                              | Type   | UX Label          | Required          | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relationships                    | array  | Relationships     | No                | Array of relationship definitions                                                 |
| relationships[].from             | string | From              | Context-dependent | Source property reference - Required at schema level, forbidden at property level |
| relationships[].id               | string | ID                | No                | Optional stable identifier for the relationship, unique within its containing `relationships` array. Recommended for elements that will be referenced. Cannot contain: `.` `#` `/` `\` `@` `!` `%` `&` `^` (RFC 0047) |
| relationships[].to               | string | To                | Yes               | Target property reference using `schema.property` notation                        |
| relationships[].type             | string | Type              | No                | Type of relationship (defaults to `foreignKey`)                                   |
| relationships[].customProperties | array  | Custom Properties | No                | Additional metadata about the relationship                                        |

### Reference Notation for Foreign Keys

Foreign key relationships support two reference notations:

**Fully Qualified Notation**

Uses the `id` field with slash-separated paths for stable references:

* `schema/users_tbl/properties/user_id_pk` - References the property with id `user_id_pk` in schema with id `users_tbl`
* `schema/accounts_tbl/properties/address_field/properties/street_field` - References nested properties

**Shorthand Notation**

For improved readability in foreign key relationships, ODCS also supports shorthand notation using the `name` field with dot-separated paths:

* `users.id` - References the `id` property in the `users` schema
* `accounts.address.street` - References nested properties

!!! note

    Shorthand notation is only supported for foreign key relationships. For all other references, use fully qualified notation.

**When to use each:**
- **Fully qualified**: Production contracts, cross-contract references, when refactoring is expected
- **Shorthand**: Simple contracts, development, when names are stable

**Composite keys**: Use arrays to define composite keys (arrays must have matching lengths)

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Foreign Key (Property Level)

When defining a relationship at the property level, the `from` field is implicit and must NOT be specified:

```yaml
schema:
  - id: users_tbl
    name: users
    properties:
      - id: user_id_field
        name: user_id
        relationships:
          # Fully qualified notation (uses id, stable)
          - to: schema/accounts_tbl/properties/owner_id_field

          # OR shorthand notation (uses name, concise)
          - to: accounts.owner_id
            # Note: DO NOT include 'from' field at property level
```

### Example 2: Multiple Relationships

A property can have multiple relationships:

```yaml
schema:
  - id: orders_tbl
    name: orders
    properties:
      - id: order_customer_id
        name: customer_id
        relationships:
          # Fully qualified notation
          - to: schema/customers_tbl/properties/cust_id_pk
          - to: schema/loyalty_tbl/properties/member_customer_id

          # OR shorthand notation
          - to: customers.id
          - to: loyalty_members.customer_id
```

### Example 3: Schema-Level Relationships

Define relationships at the schema level when you need explicit `from` and `to`. Both fields are REQUIRED at this level:

```yaml
schema:
  - id: users_tbl
    name: users
    relationships:
      # Fully qualified notation (stable)
      - from: schema/users_tbl/properties/user_account_id
        to: schema/accounts_tbl/properties/acct_id_pk
        type: foreignKey

      # OR shorthand notation (concise)
      - from: users.account_id
        to: accounts.id
        type: foreignKey
```

### Example 4: Nested Properties

Reference nested properties:

```yaml
schema:
  - id: users_tbl
    name: users
    properties:
      - id: user_id_pk
        name: id
        relationships:
          # Fully qualified notation
          - to: schema/accounts_tbl/properties/address_field/properties/postal_code_field

          # OR shorthand notation
          - to: accounts.address.postal_code
```

### Example 5: Composite Keys

For composite foreign keys, use arrays. **Important**: Both `from` and `to` must be arrays with the same number of elements:

```yaml
schema:
  - id: order_items_tbl
    name: order_items
    relationships:
      # Fully qualified notation (stable)
      - type: foreignKey
        from:
          - schema/order_items_tbl/properties/item_order_id
          - schema/order_items_tbl/properties/item_product_id
        to:
          - schema/product_inventory_tbl/properties/inv_order_id
          - schema/product_inventory_tbl/properties/inv_product_id

      # OR shorthand notation (concise)
      - type: foreignKey
        from:
          - order_items.order_id
          - order_items.product_id
        to:
          - product_inventory.order_id
          - product_inventory.product_id
```

### Example 6: Invalid Configurations

Here are examples of invalid configurations that will be rejected:

```yaml
# INVALID: 'from' specified at property level
schema:
  - name: users
    properties:
      - name: user_id
        relationships:
          - from: users.user_id  # ERROR: 'from' not allowed at property level
            to: accounts.id
```
```yaml
# INVALID: Mismatched array types
schema:
  - name: orders
    relationships:
      - from: orders.id          # ERROR: 'from' is string but 'to' is array
        to:
          - items.order_id
          - items.line_num
```
```yaml
# INVALID: Different array lengths (caught at runtime)
schema:
  - name: orders
    relationships:
      - from:                    # 'from' has 2 elements
          - orders.id
          - orders.customer_id
        to:                      # 'to' has 3 elements (runtime validation will fail)
          - items.order_id
          - items.customer_id
          - items.line_num
```
```yaml
# INVALID: Missing 'from' at schema level
schema:
  - name: orders
    relationships:
      - to: customers.id         # ERROR: 'from' is required at schema level
```
