# ✦ Context Ontology Accelerator

An open-source semantic context layer for AWS that combines knowledge graphs, formal ontologies, and rule-based systems with modern AI — enabling agents to retrieve context, validate it against business logic, and determine correct actions.

## Architecture

The system follows a **Scan → Model → Serve** workflow:

- **Scan** — Connect data sources, discover schemas, enrich metadata, ingest unstructured documents
- **Model** — Induce and manage ontologies, define metrics, build a unified semantic graph
- **Serve** — Query via SPARQL federation (VKG), traverse the knowledge graph, serve context to AI agents via MCP

Access is governed by namespace isolation and role-based access control: namespace-scoped roles (owner, maintainer, data-steward, data-analyst) plus **platform-level roles** (`platform-admin`, `platform-viewer`) that apply across all namespaces. See the [control-plane docs](packages/control-plane/README.md) for the grants and authorization model.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12, Node.js 22+, Docker
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Node package manager — installed via `mise` or `npm install -g pnpm`)
- Java 17+ and Gradle (for Smithy codegen)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)

### Setup

> **Use a release, not the tip of `main`.** We recommend starting from a tagged
> release — [github.com/aws/context-ontology-accelerator/releases](https://github.com/aws/context-ontology-accelerator/releases).
> `main` tracks ongoing development.

```bash
# Clone at the latest release tag (replace <tag> with a release from the link above)
git clone --branch <tag> https://github.com/aws/context-ontology-accelerator.git
cd context-ontology-accelerator

make setup      # install Python + CDK TypeScript dependencies
make format     # auto-format code
make lint       # check linting
make test       # run unit tests
```
