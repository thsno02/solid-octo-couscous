## Abstract

This document defines the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a
common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via
the Web.

Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies,
classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar
structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this
similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing
across diverse applications.

The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for
porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS
also provides a lightweight, intuitive language for developing and sharing
new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in
combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web
Ontology language (OWL).

This document is the normative specification of the Simple Knowledge
Organization System. It is intended for readers who are involved in the
design and implementation of information systems, and who already have a good
understanding of Semantic Web technology, especially RDF and OWL.

For an informative guide to using SKOS, see the [ SKOS-PRIMER ].


### Synopsis

Using SKOS, concepts can be
identified using URIs, labeled with
lexical strings in one or more natural languages, assigned notations (lexical codes), documented with various types of note, linked to other concepts and
organized into informal hierarchies and association networks, aggregated into concept schemes , grouped into labeled
and/or ordered collections , and mapped to concepts in other schemes.

## Status of This Document

This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
      publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current
      W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be
      found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.

This document is a W3C Recommendation developed by the Semantic Web Deployment
    Working Group , part of the W3C Semantic Web
    Activity .  This document reflects an editorial change arising during
    the Proposed Recommendation review: a non-normative example and
    preceding text was removed that suggested one means to reference
    a system of notation (e.g. a symbolic notation) in a label where
    the system of notation does not correspond to a natural language.
    This suggestion was deemed inconsistent with IETF Best Current
    Practice 47 on the use of tags for identifying languages.
    Users should consider the SKOS Extension vocabulary for support of alternate systems of notation.
    An implementation report documents known uses of SKOS
    during the Candidate Recommendation review period.  An updated SKOS Primer is being
    published concurrently with this Recommendation.

Changes Since 15 June 2009 Proposed Recommendation :

Removed final paragraph and example from section 6.5.4
      on use of private use language sub-tags.

Editorial changes to references section and citation of
      SKOS Primer.

This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy . W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with
    the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions
    for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of
    a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy .

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.

## 1. Introduction


### 1.1. Background and Motivation

The Simple Knowledge Organization System is a data-sharing standard,
bridging several different fields of knowledge, technology and practice.

In the library and information sciences, a long and distinguished heritage
is devoted to developing tools for organizing large collections of objects
such as books or museum artifacts. These tools are known generally as
"knowledge organization systems" (KOS) or sometimes as "controlled structured
vocabularies". Several similar yet distinct traditions have emerged over
time, each supported by a community of practice and set of agreed standards.
Different families of knowledge organization systems, including thesauri,
classification schemes, subject heading systems, and taxonomies are
widely recognized and applied in both modern and traditional information
systems. In practice it can be hard to draw an absolute distinction between
thesauri and classification schemes or taxonomies, although some
properties can be used to broadly characterize these different families (see
e.g., [ BS8723-3 ]).
The important point for SKOS is that, in addition to their unique features,
each of these families shares much in common, and can often be used in
similar ways [ SKOS-UCR ]. 
However, there is currently no widely deployed standard for
representing these knowledge organization systems as data and exchanging them
between computer systems.

The W3C's Semantic Web Activity [ SW ] has stimulated a new field of integrative research and
technology development, at the boundaries between database systems, formal
logic and the World Wide Web. This work has led to the development of
foundational standards for the Semantic Web. The Resource Description
Framework (RDF) provides a common data abstraction and syntax for the Web [ RDF-PRIMER ]. The
RDF Vocabulary Description language (RDFS) and the Web Ontology language
(OWL) together provide a common data modeling (schema) language for data in
the Web [ RDFS ] [ OWL-GUIDE ]. The
SPARQL Query Language and Protocol provide a standard means for interacting
with data in the Web [ SPARQL ].

These technologies are being applied across diverse applications, because
many applications require a common framework for publishing, sharing,
exchanging and integrating ("joining up") data from different sources. The
ability to link data from different sources is motivating many projects,
as different communities seek to exploit the hidden value in data
previously spread across isolated sources.

One facet of the Semantic Web vision is the hope of better organizing the
vast amounts of unstructured (i.e., human-readable) information in the Web,
providing new routes to discovering and sharing that information. RDFS and
OWL are formally defined knowledge representation languages, providing ways
of expressing meaning that are amenable to computation, meaning that
complements and gives structure to information already present in the Web [ RDF-PRIMER ] [ OWL-GUIDE ]. However, to actually apply these technologies over large bodies of information
requires the construction of detailed maps of particular domains of
knowledge, in addition to the accurate description (i.e., annotation or
cataloging) of information resources on a large scale, much of which cannot
be done automatically. The accumulated experience and best practices in the
library and information sciences regarding the organization of information
and knowledge are obviously complementary and applicable to this vision, as
are the many existing knowledge organization systems already developed and in
use, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings [ LCSH ] or the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization's AGROVOC Thesaurus [ AGROVOC ].

The Simple Knowledge Organization System therefore aims to provide a
bridge between different communities of practice within the library and
information sciences involved in the design and application of knowledge
organization systems. In addition, SKOS aims to provide a bridge between
these communities and the Semantic Web, by transferring existing models of
knowledge organization to the Semantic Web technology context, and by
providing a low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge
organization systems to RDF.

Looking to the future, SKOS occupies a position between the exploitation
and analysis of unstructured information, the informal and socially-mediated
organization of information on a large scale, and the formal representation
of knowledge. By making the accumulated experience and
wisdom of knowledge organization in the library and information sciences
accessible, applicable and transferable to the technological context
of the Semantic Web, in a way that is complementary to existing Semantic Web
technology (and in particular formal systems of knowledge representation such
as OWL), it is hoped that SKOS will enable many new and valuable applications, and will also
lead to new integrative lines of research and development in both technology
and practice.


### 1.2. SKOS Overview

The Simple Knowledge Organization System is a common data model for
knowledge organization systems such as thesauri, classification schemes,
subject heading systems and taxonomies. Using SKOS, a knowledge organization
system can be expressed as machine-readable data . It can
then be exchanged between computer applications and published in a
machine-readable format in the Web.

The SKOS data model is formally defined in this specification as an OWL
Full ontology [ OWL-SEMANTICS ]. SKOS data are expressed as RDF
triples [ RDF-CONCEPTS ], and may be encoded using any
concrete RDF syntax (such as RDF/XML [ RDF-XML ] or Turtle [ TURTLE ]). For more on the relationships
between SKOS, RDF and OWL, see the next sub-section below.

The SKOS data model views a knowledge organization system as a concept scheme comprising a set of concepts . These SKOS concept schemes and SKOS concepts are
identified by URIs, enabling anyone to refer to them unambiguously from any
context, and making them a part of the World Wide Web. See Section 3. The skos:Concept Class for more on
identifying and describing SKOS concepts, and Section 4.
Concept Schemes for more on concept schemes.

SKOS concepts can be labeled with any number of lexical
(UNICODE) strings, such as "romantic love" or "れんあい", in any given
natural language, such as English or Japanese (written here in hiragana). One of these labels
in any given language can be indicated as the preferred label for that
language, and the others as alternative labels. Labels may also be "hidden",
which is useful where a knowledge organization system is being queried
via a text index. See Section 5. Lexical Labels for
more on the SKOS lexical labeling properties.

SKOS concepts can be assigned one or more notations ,
which are lexical codes used to uniquely identify the concept within the
scope of a given concept scheme. While URIs are the preferred means of
identifying SKOS concepts within computer systems, notations provide a bridge
to other systems of identification already in use such as classification
codes used in library catalogs. See Section 6.
Notations for more on notations.

SKOS concepts can be documented with notes of various
types. The SKOS data model provides a basic set of documentation properties,
supporting scope notes, definitions and editorial notes, among others. This
set is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide a framework that can
be extended by third parties to provide support for more specific types of
note. See Section 7. Documentation Properties for more
on notes.

SKOS concepts can be linked to other SKOS concepts via
semantic relation properties. The SKOS data model provides support for
hierarchical and associative links between SKOS concepts. Again, as with any
part of the SKOS data model, these can be extended by third parties to
provide support for more specific needs. See Section 8. Semantic Relations for more on
linking SKOS concepts.

SKOS concepts can be grouped into collections , which can
be labeled and/or ordered. This feature of the SKOS data model is intended to
provide support for node labels within thesauri, and for situations where the
ordering of a set of concepts is meaningful or provides some useful
information. See Section 9. Concept Collections for more on collections.

SKOS concepts can be mapped to other SKOS concepts in
different concept schemes. The SKOS data model provides support for four
basic types of mapping link: hierarchical, associative, close equivalent and
exact equivalent. See Section 10. Mapping Properties for more on mapping.

Finally, an optional extension to SKOS is defined in Appendix B. SKOS eXtension for Labels (SKOS-XL) . SKOS-XL provides more
support for identifying, describing and linking lexical entities.


### 1.3. SKOS, RDF and OWL

The elements of the SKOS data model are classes and properties, and the
structure and integrity of the data model is defined by the logical
characteristics of, and interdependencies between, those classes and
properties. This is perhaps one of the most powerful and yet potentially
confusing aspects of SKOS, because SKOS can, in more advanced applications,
also be used side-by-side with OWL to express and exchange knowledge about a
domain. However, SKOS is not a formal knowledge
representation language.

To understand this distinction, consider that the "knowledge" made
explicit in a formal ontology is expressed as sets of axioms and facts. A
thesaurus or classification scheme is of a completely different nature, and
does not assert any axioms or facts. Rather, a thesaurus or classification
scheme identifies and describes, through natural language and other informal
means, a set of distinct ideas or meanings, which are sometimes
conveniently referred to as "concepts". These "concepts" may also be arranged
and organized into various structures, most commonly hierarchies and
association networks. These structures, however, do not have any formal
semantics, and cannot be reliably interpreted as either formal axioms or
facts about the world. Indeed they were never intended to be so, for they
serve only to provide a convenient and intuitive map of some subject
domain, which can then be used as an aid to organizing and finding objects,
such as documents, which are relevant to that domain.

To make the "knowledge" embedded in a thesaurus or classification scheme
explicit in any formal sense requires that the thesaurus or classification
scheme be re-engineered as a formal ontology. In other words, some
person has to do the work of transforming the structure and intellectual
content of a thesaurus or classification scheme into a set of formal axioms
and facts. This work of transformation is both intellectually demanding and
time consuming, and therefore costly. Much can be gained from using thesauri, 
etc., as-is, as informal, convenient structures for navigation within a
subject domain. Using them as-is does not require any re-engineering and
is therefore much less costly. In addition, some KOS are, by design, not
intended to represent a logical view of their domain. Converting such KOS to a
formal logic-based representation may, in practice, involve changes which result
in a representation that no longer meets the originally intended purpose.

OWL does, however, provide a powerful data modeling language. We can,
therefore, use OWL to construct a data model for representing thesauri or
classification schemes as-is. This is exactly what SKOS does. Taking this
approach, the "concepts" of a thesaurus or classification scheme are modeled
as individuals in the SKOS data model, and the informal descriptions about
and links between those "concepts" as given by the thesaurus or
classification scheme are modeled as facts about those individuals, never as
class or property axioms. Note that these are facts about the thesaurus or classification scheme itself , such as "concept X
has preferred label 'Y' and is part of thesaurus Z"; these are not facts about the way the world is arranged within a
particular subject domain, as might be expressed in a formal ontology.

SKOS data are then expressed as RDF triples. The RDF graph
below (in [ TURTLE ]
as discussed in Section 1.7.3 ) expresses some facts
about a thesaurus.

<A> rdf:type skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "love"@en ;
  skos:altLabel "adoration"@en ;
  skos:broader <B> ;
  skos:inScheme <S> .

<B> rdf:type skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "emotion"@en ;
  skos:altLabel "feeling"@en ;
  skos:topConceptOf <S> .

<S> rdf:type skos:ConceptScheme ;
  dct:title "My First Thesaurus" ;
  skos:hasTopConcept <B> .

This point is vital to understanding the formal definition of the SKOS
data model and how it may be implemented in software systems. This point is
also vital to more advanced applications of SKOS, especially where SKOS and
OWL are used in combination as part of a hybrid formal/semi-formal design.

From a user's point of view, however, the distinction between a formal
knowledge representation system and an informal or semi-formal knowledge
organization system may naturally become blurred. In other words, it may not
be relevant to a user that <A> and <B> in the graph below are individuals (instances of skos:Concept ),
and <C> and <D> are classes (instances
of owl:Class ) .

<A> rdf:type skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "love"@en ;
  skos:broader <B> .

<B> rdf:type skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "emotion"@en .

<C> rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "mammals"@en ;
  rdfs:subClassOf <D> .

<D> rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "animals"@en .

An information system that has any awareness of the SKOS data model will,
however, need to appreciate the distinction.

RDF schemas for SKOS and the SKOS eXtension for Labels (SKOS-XL) are described
in Appendix C. SKOS and SKOS-XL Namespace Documents . Note
that, as there are constraints that cannot be completely captured in the
schema, the RDF/XML document provides a normative subset of this
specification.


### 1.4. Consistency and Integrity

Under the RDF and OWL Full semantics, the formal meaning
( interpretation ) of an RDF graph is a truth value [ RDF-SEMANTICS ]
[ OWL-SEMANTICS ], i.e., an RDF graph is
interpreted as either true or false.

In general, an RDF graph is said to be inconsistent if it cannot
possibly be true. In other words, an RDF graph is inconsistent if it contains
a contradiction.

Using the RDF and RDFS vocabularies alone, it is virtually impossible to
make a contradictory statement. When the OWL vocabulary is used as well,
there are many ways to state a contradiction, e.g., consider the RDF
graph below.

<Dog> rdf:type owl:Class .
<Cat> rdf:type owl:Class .
<Dog> owl:disjointWith <Cat> .
<dogcat> rdf:type <Dog> , <Cat> .

The graph states that <Dog> and <Cat> are both classes, and that they are disjoint, i.e.,
that they do not have any members in common. This is contradicted by the
statement that <dogcat> has type both <Dog> and <Cat> . There is no OWL Full
interpretation which can satisfy this graph, and therefore this graph is not OWL Full consistent.

When OWL Full is used as a knowledge representation language, the notion
of inconsistency is useful because it reveals contradictions within the
axioms and facts that are asserted in an ontology. By resolving these
inconsistencies we learn more about a domain of knowledge, and come to a
better model of that domain from which interesting and valid inferences can
be drawn.

When OWL Full is used as a data modeling (i.e., schema) language, the
notion of inconsistency is again useful, but in a different way. Here we are
not concerned with the logical consistency of human knowledge itself. We are
simply interested in formally defining a data model, so that we can establish
with certainty whether or not some given data fit with (i.e., conform to) the
given data model. If the data are inconsistent with respect to the data
model, then the data does not fit.

Here, we are not concerned with whether or not some given data have any
correspondence with the real world, i.e., whether they are true or false in any
absolute sense. We are simply interested in whether or not the data fit the
data model, because interoperability within a given class of applications
depends on data conforming to a common data model.

Another way to express this view is via the notion of integrity .
Integrity conditions are statements within the formal definition of a data
model, which are used to establish whether or not given data are consistent
with respect to the data model, e.g., the statement that <Dog> and <Cat> are disjoint classes can be viewed as an integrity
condition on a data model. Given this condition, the data below are then not consistent.

<dogcat> rdf:type <Dog> , <Cat> .

The definition of the SKOS data model given in this document contains a
limited number of statements that are intended as integrity conditions. These
integrity conditions are included to promote interoperability, by defining
the circumstances under which data are not consistent with
respect to the SKOS data model. Tools can then be implemented which check
whether some or all of these integrity conditions are met for given data, and
therefore whether the data are consistent with the SKOS data model.

These integrity conditions are part of the formal definition of the
classes and properties of the SKOS data model. However, they are presented
separately from other parts of the formal definition because they serve a
different purpose. Integrity conditions serve primarily to establish whether
given data are consistent with the SKOS data model. All other statements
within the definition of the SKOS data model serve only to
support logical inferences. (See also the next sub-section.)

Integrity conditions are defined for the SKOS data model in a way that is
independent of strategies for their implementation, in so far as that is
possible. This is because there are several different ways in which a
procedure to find inconsistencies with the SKOS data model could be
implemented. Inconsistencies could be found using an OWL
reasoner. Alternatively, some inconsistencies could be found by searching for
specific patterns within the data, or by a hybrid strategy (e.g., drawing inferences
using an RDFS or OWL reasoner, then searching for patterns in the inferred
graph).

The integrity conditions on the SKOS data model are fewer than might be
expected, especially for those used to working within the closed world of
database systems. See also the next sub-section, and the notes in sections
3-10 below.


### 1.5. Inference, Dependency and the Open World Assumption

This document defines the SKOS data model as an OWL Full ontology. There
are other ways in which the SKOS data model could have been
defined, for example as an entity-relationship model, or a UML class model.
Although OWL Full as a data modeling language appears intuitively similar in
many ways to these other modeling approaches, there is an important
fundamental distinction.

RDF and OWL Full are designed for systems in which data may be widely
distributed (e.g., the Web). As such a system becomes larger, it becomes both
impractical and virtually impossible to know where all of the data in the
system are located. Therefore, one cannot generally assume that data obtained
from such a system are complete. If some data appear to be missing,
one has to assume, in general, that the data might exist somewhere
else in the system. This assumption, roughly speaking, is known as the open world assumption [ OWL-GUIDE ].

This means in practice that, for a data model defined as an OWL Full
ontology, some definitions can have a counter-intuitive meaning. No
conclusions can be drawn from missing data, and removing something will
never make the remaining data inconsistent. This is illustrated, for example, by the definition of skos:semanticRelation in Section 8 below. The
property skos:semanticRelation is defined to have domain and
range skos:Concept . These domain and range definitions give
license to inferences . Consider the graph below.

<A> skos:semanticRelation <B>.

In this case, the graph above entails the following
graph.

<A> rdf:type skos:Concept .
<B> rdf:type skos:Concept .

Thus, we do not need to explicitly state here that <A> and <B> are instances of skos:Concept , because such statements are entailed by the definition of skos:semanticRelation .

In the SKOS data model, most statements of definition are not integrity conditions, but are statements of logical
dependency between different elements of the data model, which (under the
open world assumption) give license to a number of simple inferences. This is illustrated, for
example, by the statement in Section 7 below that skos:broader and skos:narrower are 
inverse properties. This statement means that

<A> skos:narrower <B> .

entails

<B> skos:broader <A> .

Both of these two graphs are, by themselves, consistent with the SKOS data
model.

Knowledge organization systems such as thesauri and classification schemes
are applied in a wide range of situations, and an individual knowledge
organization system can be used in many different information systems. By
defining the SKOS data model as an OWL Full ontology, the Semantic Web can
then be used as a medium for publishing, exchanging, sharing and linking
data involving these knowledge organization systems. For this reason, for the
expressiveness of OWL Full as a data modeling language, and for the
possibility of using thesauri, classification schemes, etc., side-by-side with
formal ontologies, OWL Full has been used to define the SKOS data model. The
open world assumption is therefore a fundamental premise of the SKOS data
model, and should be borne in mind when reading this document.

See also [ RDF-PRIMER ] and [ OWL-GUIDE ].


### 1.6. Design Rationale


### 1.7. How to Read this Document

This document formally defines the Simple Knowledge Organization System
data model as an OWL Full ontology. The elements of the SKOS data model are
OWL classes and properties, and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is
provided for each of these classes and properties so that they may be used
unambiguously in the Web. This set of URIs is the SKOS vocabulary.

The complete SKOS vocabulary is given in section 2 below. Sections 3 to 10
then formally define the SKOS data model. The definition of the data model is
broken down into a number of sections purely for convenience. Each of these
sections 3 to 10 follows a common layout:

Preamble — the main ideas covered in the section are
    introduced informally.

Vocabulary — URIs from the SKOS vocabulary which are
    defined in the section are given.

Class & Property Definitions — the logical
    characteristics and interdependencies between the classes and properties
    denoted by those URIs are formally defined.

Integrity Conditions — if there are any integrity
    conditions, those are given.

Examples — some canonical examples are given, both
    of data which are consistent with the SKOS data model,
    and (where appropriate) of data which are not consistent
    with the SKOS data model.

Notes — any further notes and discussion are
    presented.


#### 1.7.1. Formal Definitions

Most of the class and property definitions and integrity conditions stated
in this document could be stated as RDF triples, using the RDF, RDFS and OWL
vocabularies. However, a small number cannot, either because of limitations
in the expressiveness of OWL Full or lack of a standard URI for some class. To
improve the overall readability of this document, rather than mix RDF triples
and other notations, the formal definitions and integrity conditions are
stated throughout using prose.

The style of this prose generally follows the style used in [ RDFS ], and should be
clear to a reader with a working knowledge of RDF and OWL.

So, for example, " ex:Person is an instance of owl:Class " means

ex:Person rdf:type owl:Class .

" ex:hasParent and ex:hasMother are each
instances of owl:ObjectProperty " means:

ex:hasParent rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
ex:hasMother rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .

" ex:hasMother is a sub-property of ex:hasParent "
means

ex:hasMother rdfs:subPropertyOf ex:hasParent .

"the rdfs:range of ex:hasParent is the class ex:Person " means:

ex:hasParent rdfs:range ex:Person .

Where some formal aspects of the SKOS data model cannot be stated as RDF
triples using either RDF, RDFS or OWL vocabularies, it should be clear to a
reader with a basic understanding of the RDF and OWL semantics how these
statements might be translated into formal conditions on the interpretation
of an RDF vocabulary (e.g., from Section 5 , "A resource has no more
than one value of skos:prefLabel per language tag" means for any
resource x, no two members of the set { y | <x,y> is in
IEXT(I( skos:prefLabel )) } share the same language tag, where I
and IEXT are functions as defined in [ RDF-SEMANTICS ]).


#### 1.7.2. URI Abbreviations

Full URIs are cited in the text of this document in monospace font,
enclosed by angle brackets, e.g., <http://example.org/ns/example> . Relative URIs are cited
in the same way, and are relative to the base URI <http://example.org/ns/> , e.g., <example> and <http://example.org/ns/example> are the same URI.

URIs are also cited in the text of this document in an abbreviated form.
Abbreviated URIs are cited in monospace font without angle brackets, and
should be expanded using the table of abbreviations below.

So, for example, skos:Concept is an abbreviation of <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept> .


#### 1.7.3. Examples

Examples of RDF graphs are given using the Terse RDF Triple language
(Turtle) [ TURTLE ].
All examples assume that they are preceded by the following prefix and URI
base directives:

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> . @prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> . @base <http://example.org/ns/> .

Therefore, the example given below

is equivalent to the following Turtle document

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> . @prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> . @base <http://example.org/ns/> .
    
<MyConcept> rdf:type skos:Concept .

which is equivalent to the following RDF/XML document [ RDF-XML ]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" xmlns:skos="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#" xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#" xml:base="http://example.org/ns/">
    
    <skos:Concept rdf:about="MyConcept"/>
    
</rdf:RDF>

which is equivalent to the following N-TRIPLES document [ NTRIPLES ]

<http://example.org/ns/MyConcept> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept> .

Note the use in Turtle of the ";" and "," characters to abbreviate
multiple triples with the same subject or predicate. Some examples also make
use of the Turtle syntax "(...)", representing an RDF Collection.


### 1.8. Conformance

This specification does not define a formal notion of conformance.

However, an RDF graph will be inconsistent with the SKOS
data model if that graph and the SKOS data model (as defined formally below)
taken together lead to a logical contradiction.

Where URIs are used to identify resources of type skos:Concept , skos:ConceptScheme , skos:Collection or skosxl:Label , this specification does not require specific behavior when dereferencing those
URIs via the Web [ WEBARCH ]. It is, however, strongly recommended that
publishers of SKOS data follow the guidelines given in [ COOLURIS ] and [ RECIPES ].


## 2. SKOS Namespace and Vocabulary

The SKOS namespace URI is:

http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#

The SKOS vocabulary is a set of URIs, given in the left-hand column in the
table below.

All URIs in the SKOS vocabulary are constructed by appending a local name
(e.g., "prefLabel") to the SKOS namespace URI.

See also the SKOS overview in Appendix B and the quick access panel .


## 3. The skos:Concept Class


### 3.1. Preamble

The class skos:Concept is the class of SKOS concepts.

A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought.
However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this
definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive.

The notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or
intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring
to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS.

Note that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing
semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain
amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this
class.

See the [ SKOS-PRIMER ] for
more examples of identifying and describing SKOS concepts.


### 3.2. Vocabulary


### 3.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 3.4. Examples

The graph below states that <MyConcept> is a SKOS
concept (i.e., an instance of skos:Concept ).


### 3.5. Notes


#### 3.5.1. SKOS Concepts, OWL Classes and OWL Properties

Other than the assertion that skos:Concept is an instance of owl:Class , this specification does not make any
additional statement about the formal relationship between the class of SKOS
concepts and the class of OWL classes. The decision not to
make any such statement has been made to allow applications the freedom to
explore different design patterns for working with SKOS in combination with
OWL.

In the example graph below, <MyConcept> is an
instance of skos:Concept and an instance of owl:Class .

This example is consistent with the SKOS data
model.

Similarly, this specification does not make any
statement about the formal relationship between the class of SKOS
concepts and the class of OWL properties.

In the example graph below, <MyConcept> is
an instance of skos:Concept and an
instance of owl:ObjectProperty .

This example is consistent with the SKOS data
model.


## 4. Concept Schemes


### 4.1. Preamble

A SKOS concept scheme can be viewed as an aggregation of one or more SKOS
concepts. Semantic relationships (links) between those concepts may also be
viewed as part of a concept scheme. This definition is, however, meant to be
suggestive rather than restrictive, and there is some flexibility in the
formal data model stated below.

The notion of a concept scheme is useful when dealing with data from an
unknown source, and when dealing with data that describes two or more
different knowledge organization systems.

See the [ SKOS-PRIMER ] for
more examples of identifying and describing concept schemes.


### 4.2. Vocabulary


### 4.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 4.4. Integrity Conditions


### 4.5. Examples

The graph below describes a concept scheme with two SKOS concepts, one of
which is a top-level concept in that scheme.


### 4.6. Notes


#### 4.6.1. Closed vs. Open Systems

The notion of an individual SKOS concept scheme corresponds roughly to the notion of an individual thesaurus,
classification scheme, subject heading system or other knowledge organization
system.

However, in most current information systems, a thesaurus or
classification scheme is treated as a closed system —
conceptual units defined within that system cannot take part in other systems
(although they can be mapped to units in other systems).

Although SKOS does take a similar approach, there are no conditions preventing a SKOS concept from taking part in zero, one, or more
than one concept scheme.

So, for example, in the graph below the SKOS concept <MyConcept> takes part in two different concept schemes
— this is consistent with the SKOS data model.

This flexibility is desirable because it allows, for example, new concept
schemes to be described by linking two or more existing concept schemes
together.

Also, note that there is no way to close the boundary of a concept scheme.
So, while it is possible using skos:inScheme to say that SKOS
concepts X, Y and Z take part in concept scheme A, there is no way to say
that only X, Y and Z take part in A.

Therefore, while SKOS can be used to describe a concept
scheme, SKOS does not provide any mechanism to completely define a concept scheme.


#### 4.6.2. SKOS Concept Schemes and OWL Ontologies

This specification does not make any statement about the
formal relationship between the class of SKOS concept schemes and the class
of OWL ontologies. The decision not to make any such
statement has been made to allow different design patterns to be explored for
using SKOS in combination with OWL [ OWL-GUIDE ].

In the example graph below, <MyScheme> is
both a SKOS concept scheme and an OWL ontology. This
is consistent with the SKOS data model.


#### 4.6.3. Top Concepts and Semantic Relations

The property skos:hasTopConcept is, by convention, used to
link a concept scheme to the SKOS concept(s) which are topmost in the
hierarchical relations for that scheme. However, there are no integrity
conditions enforcing this convention. Therefore, the graph below, whilst not
strictly adhering to the usage convention for skos:hasTopConcept , is nevertheless consistent with the SKOS data model.

An application may reject such data but is not required to.


#### 4.6.4. Scheme Containment and Semantic Relations

A link between two SKOS concepts does not entail
containment within the same concept scheme. This is illustrated in the
example below.

does not entail

See also Section 8 below.


#### 4.6.5. Domain of skos:inScheme

Note that no domain is stated for the property skos:inScheme , i.e., the domain is effectively the class of all
resources ( rdfs:Resource ). The decision not to state any domain
has been made to provide some flexibility, enabling extensions to SKOS to
define new classes of resource but still use skos:inScheme to
link them to a skos:ConceptScheme . See also example 82 below.


## 5. Lexical Labels


### 5.1. Preamble

A lexical label is a string of UNICODE characters, such as "romantic love"
or "れんあい", in a given natural language, such as English or Japanese (written here in hiragana).

The Simple Knowledge Organization System provides some basic vocabulary
for associating lexical labels with resources of any type. In particular,
SKOS enables a distinction to be made between the preferred, alternative
and "hidden" lexical labels for any given resource.

The preferred and alternative labels are useful when generating or
creating human-readable representations of a knowledge organization system.
These labels provide the strongest clues as to the meaning of a SKOS
concept.

The hidden labels are useful when a user is interacting with a knowledge
organization system via a text-based search function. The user may, for
example, enter mis-spelled words when trying to find a relevant concept. If
the mis-spelled query can be matched against a hidden label, the user will
be able to find the relevant concept, but the hidden label won't otherwise
be visible to the user (so further mistakes aren't encouraged).

Formally, a lexical label is an RDF plain literal [ RDF-CONCEPTS ]. An RDF plain
literal is composed of a lexical form, which is a string of UNICODE
characters, and an optional language tag, which is a string of characters
conforming to the syntax defined by [ BCP47 ].

See the [ SKOS-PRIMER ] for
  more examples of labeling SKOS concepts. Note especially that the examples below 
  serve only to illustrate general features of the SKOS data model, and do not necessarily indicate best practice for the provision of labels with 
  different language tags. The SKOS Reference aims to establish a data model 
  that is applicable across a range of situations, which may then be refined and/or 
  constrained by usage conventions for more specific situations. Application- and 
  language-specific usage conventions with respect to labels and language tags 
  are out of scope for the SKOS Reference.


### 5.2. Vocabulary


### 5.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 5.4. Integrity Conditions


### 5.5. Examples

The following graph is consistent , and illustrates the
provision of lexical labels in two different languages (French and
English).

The following graph is consistent and illustrates the provision of lexical labels in four different variations (Japanese written with 
kanji, the hiragana script, the katakana script or with latin characters (rōmaji)).

The following graph is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because two different preferred lexical labels have been given with the
same language tag.

The following graph is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between the preferred and alternative lexical
labels.

The following graph is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between alternative and hidden lexical
labels.

The following graph is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between preferred and hidden lexical
labels.


### 5.6. Notes


#### 5.6.1. Domain of SKOS Lexical Labeling Properties

Note that no domain is stated for skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel . Thus, the effective domain of these properties
is the class of all resources ( rdfs:Resource ).

Therefore, using the properties skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel to label
any type of resource is consistent with the SKOS
data model.

In the example graph below, skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel have been used
to label a resource of type owl:Class — this is consistent with the SKOS data model.


#### 5.6.2. Range of SKOS Lexical Labeling Properties

Note that the range of skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel is the class of
RDF plain literals [ RDF-CONCEPTS ].

By convention, RDF plain literals are always used in the object position
of a triple, where the predicate is one of skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel or skos:hiddenLabel . If a
graph does not follow this usage convention an
application may reject such data but is not required to. See also the
note below.


#### 5.6.3. Defining Label Relations

Some applications require additional functionality relating to labels, for
example allowing the description of those labels or the definition of
additional relations between the labels (such as acronyms). This can be
achieved through the identification of labels using URIs. The SKOS eXtension
for Labels defined in Appendix A provides support for
this.


#### 5.6.4. Alternates Without Preferred

In the graph below, a resource has two alternative lexical labels, but no
preferred lexical label. This is consistent with the SKOS
data model, and there are no additional entailments which follow from the
data model. However, note that many applications will require a preferred
lexical label in order to generate an optimum human-readable display.


#### 5.6.5. Labeling and Language Tags

[ BCP47 ]
defines tags for identifying languages. Note that "en", "en-GB", "en-US" are 
three different language
tags, used with English, British English and US English respectively.
Similarly "ja", "ja-Hani", "ja-Hira", "ja-Kana" and "ja-Latn" are five
different language tags used with Japanese, Japanese written with 
kanji, the hiragana script, the katakana script or with latin characters (rōmaji) respectively.

The graph below is consistent with the SKOS data
model, because "en", "en-US" and "en-GB" are different language tags.

In the graph below, there is no clash between the lexical labeling
properties, again because "en" and "en-GB" are different language tags, and 
therefore the graph is consistent with the SKOS data model.

Note however that, as stated above in section 5.1, these examples serve only to illustrate general features of the SKOS data model, and do not necessarily indicate best practice for the provision of labels with different language tags. Application- and language-specific usage conventions with respect to labels and language tags are out of scope for the SKOS Reference.

It is suggested that applications match requests for labels in a
    given language to labels with related language tags that are provided by a SKOS concept scheme, e.g., by implementing the "lookup" algorithm defined by [ BCP
      47 ]. Applications that perform matching in this way do not require labels to be provided in all possible language variations (of which there could be many), and are compatible with SKOS concept schemes that
    provide only those labels whose lexical forms are distinct for a given
    language or collection of languages.


## 6. Notations


### 6.1. Preamble

A notation is a string of characters such as "T58.5" or "303.4833" used to
uniquely identify a concept within the scope of a given concept scheme.

A notation is different from a lexical label in that a notation is not
normally recognizable as a word or sequence of words in any natural
language.

This section defines the skos:notation property. This
property is used to assign a notation as a typed literal
[ RDF-CONCEPTS ].


### 6.2. Vocabulary


### 6.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 6.4. Examples

The example below illustrates a resource <http://example.com/ns/MyConcept> with a notation whose
lexical form is the UNICODE string "303.4833" and whose datatype is denoted
by the URI <http://example.com/ns/MyNotationDatatype> .


### 6.5. Notes


#### 6.5.1. Notations, Typed Literals and Datatypes

A typed literal is a UNICODE string combined with a datatype URI [ RDF-CONCEPTS ].

Typed literals are commonly used to denote values such as integers,
floating point numbers and dates, and there are a number of datatypes
pre-defined by the XML Schema specification [ XML-SCHEMA ] such as xs:integer , xs:float and xs:date .

For other situations, new datatypes can be defined, and these are
commonly called "user-defined datatypes" [ SWBP-DATATYPES ].

By convention, the property skos:notation is only used with a
typed literal in the object position of the triple, where the datatype URI
denotes a user-defined datatype corresponding to a particular system of
notations or classification codes.

For many situations it may be sufficient to simply coin a datatype URI for
a particular notation system, and define the datatype informally via a
document that describes how the notations are constructed and/or which
lexical forms are allowed. Note, however, that it is also possible to define
at least the lexical space of a datatype more formally via the XML Schema
language, see [ SWBP-DATATYPES ] section 2. Users
should be aware that tools may vary in their support of
datatypes. However, as discussed in [ OWL-REFERENCE ] section
6.3, tools should at least treat lexically identical literals as
equal.


#### 6.5.2. Multiple Notations

There are no constraints on the cardinality of the skos:notation property. A concept may have zero, 1 or more
notations.

Where a concept has more than 1 notation, these may be from the same or
different notation systems. In the case where notations are from different
systems, different datatypes may be used to indicate this. It is not
common practice to assign more than one notation from the same notation
system (i.e., with the same datatype URI).


#### 6.5.3. Unique Notations in Concept Schemes

By convention, no two concepts in the same concept scheme are given the
same notation. If they were, it would not be possible to use the notation to
uniquely refer to a concept (i.e., the notation would become ambiguous).


#### 6.5.4. Notations and Preferred Labels

There are no constraints on the combined use of skos:notation and skos:prefLabel . In the example below, the same string is
given both as the lexical form of a notation and as a the lexical form of a
preferred label.

Typed literals consist of a string of characters and a datatype
URI.  By convention, skos:notation is only used
with typed literals in the object position of the
triple.

Plain literals consist of a string of characters and a language tag. By
convention, skos:prefLabel (and skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel ) are only used with plain
literals in the object position of the triple.

There is no such thing as an RDF literal with both a language tag and a
datatype URI, i.e., a typed literal does not have a language tag, and a plain
literal does not have a datatype URI.


#### 6.5.5. Domain of skos:notation

Note that no domain is stated for skos:notation . Thus, the 
effective domain is the class of all resources ( rdfs:Resource ).
Therefore, using skos:notation with any type of resource is 
consistent with the SKOS data model.


## 7. Documentation Properties (Note Properties)


### 7.1. Preamble

Notes are used to provide information relating to SKOS concepts. There is
no restriction on the nature of this information, e.g., it could be
plain text, hypertext, or an image; it could be a definition, information
about the scope of a concept, editorial information, or any other type of
information.

There are seven properties in SKOS for associating notes with concepts,
defined formally in this section. For more information on the recommended
usage of each of the SKOS documentation properties, see the [ SKOS-PRIMER ].

These seven properties are not intended to cover every situation, but
rather to be useful in some of the most common situations, and to provide a
set of extension points for defining more specific types of note. For more
information on recommended best practice for extending SKOS, see the [ SKOS-PRIMER ].

Three different usage patterns are recommended in the [ SKOS-PRIMER ] for the SKOS
documentation properties — "documentation as an RDF literal",
"documentation as a related resource description" and "documentation as a
document reference". The data model defined in this section is intended
to accommodate all three design patterns.


### 7.2. Vocabulary


### 7.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 7.4. Examples

The graph below gives an example of the "documentation as an RDF literal"
pattern.

The graph below gives an example of the "documentation as a document
reference" pattern.


### 7.5. Notes


#### 7.5.1. Domain of the SKOS Documentation Properties

Note that no domain is stated for the SKOS documentation
properties. Thus, the effective domain for these properties is the class of
all resources ( rdfs:Resource ). Therefore, using the SKOS
documentation properties to provide information on any type of
resource is consistent with the SKOS data model.

In the example graph below, skos:definition has been
used to provide a plain text definition for a resource of type owl:Class — this is consistent with the SKOS data model.


#### 7.5.2. Range of the SKOS Documentation
Properties

Note that no range is stated for the SKOS documentation properties,
and thus the range of these properties is effectively the class of all
resources ( rdfs:Resource ). Under the RDF and OWL Full semantics,
everything is a resource, including RDF plain literals.


## 8. Semantic Relations


### 8.1. Preamble

SKOS semantic relations are links between SKOS concepts, where the link is
inherent in the meaning of the linked concepts.

The Simple Knowledge Organization System distinguishes between two basic
categories of semantic relation: hierarchical and associative . A hierarchical link between two concepts
indicates that one is in some way more general ("broader") than the other
("narrower"). An associative link between two concepts indicates that the two
are inherently "related", but that one is not in any way
more general than the other.

The properties skos:broader and skos:narrower are used to assert a direct hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. A
triple <A> skos:broader <B> asserts that <B> , the object of the triple, is a broader concept than <A> , the subject of the triple. Similarly, a triple <C> skos:narrower <D> asserts that <D> , the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than <C> , the subject of the triple.

By convention, skos:broader and skos:narrower are only used to assert a direct (i.e.,
immediate) hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. This provides
applications with a convenient and reliable way to access the direct broader
and narrower links for any given concept. Note that, to support this usage
convention, the properties skos:broader and skos:narrower are not declared as transitive
properties.

Some applications need to make use of both direct and
indirect hierarchical links between concepts, for instance to
improve search recall through query expansion. For this purpose, the
properties skos:broaderTransitive and skos:narrowerTransitive are provided. A triple <A> skos:broaderTransitive <B> represents a direct or indirect hierarchical link,
where <B> is a broader "ancestor" of <A> . Similarly a triple <C>
skos:narrowerTransitive <D> represents a direct or indirect
hierarchical link, where <D> is a narrower "descendant" of <C> .

By convention, the properties skos:broaderTransitive and skos:narrowerTransitive are not used to make
assertions. Rather, these properties are used to infer the transitive closure
of the hierarchical links, which can then be used to access direct or
indirect hierarchical links between concepts.

The property skos:related is used to assert an associative
link between two SKOS concepts.

For more examples of stating hierarchical and associative links, see the
[ SKOS-PRIMER ].


### 8.2. Vocabulary


### 8.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 8.4. Integrity Conditions

Note that because skos:related is a symmetric property, and skos:broaderTransitive and skos:narrowerTransitive are inverses, skos:related is therefore also disjoint with skos:narrowerTransitive .


### 8.5. Examples

The graph below asserts a direct hierarchical link between <A> and <B> (where <B> is broader than <A> ), and an
associative link between <A> and <C> ,
and is consistent with the SKOS data model.

The graph below is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between associative links and hierarchical
links.

The graph below is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, again because there is a clash between associative links and
hierarchical links.

In the example above, the clash is not immediately obvious. The clash
becomes apparent when inferences are drawn, based on the class and property
definitions above, giving the following graph.

The graph below is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, again because there is a clash between associative links and
hierarchical links, which can be inferred from the class and property
definitions given above.


### 8.6. Notes


#### 8.6.1. Sub-Property Relationships

The diagram below illustrates informally the sub-property relationships
between the SKOS semantic relation properties.

skos:semanticRelation
 |
 +— skos:related
 |
 +— skos:broaderTransitive
 |    |
 |    +— skos:broader
 |
 +— skos:narrowerTransitive
      |
      +— skos:narrower


#### 8.6.2. Domain and Range of SKOS Semantic Relation
Properties

Note that the domain and range of skos:semanticRelation is
the class skos:Concept . Because skos:broader , skos:narrower and skos:related are each
sub-properties of skos:semanticRelation , the graph in example 26 above entails that <A> , <B> and <C> are each instances of skos:Concept .


#### 8.6.3. Symmetry of skos:related

skos:related is a symmetric property. The example below
illustrates an entailment which follows from this condition.

entails

Note that, although skos:related is a symmetric property,
this condition does not place any restrictions on
sub-properties of skos:related (i.e., sub-properties of skos:related could be symmetric, not symmetric or antisymmetric,
and still be consistent with the SKOS data model).

To illustrate this point, in the example below, two new properties which
are not symmetric are declared as sub-properties of skos:related . The example, which is consistent with the SKOS data model, also shows some of the entailments which follow.

entails

See also the [ SKOS-PRIMER ]
for best practice recommendations on extending SKOS.


#### 8.6.4. skos:related and Transitivity

Note that skos:related is not a transitive
property. Therefore, the SKOS data model does not support an
entailment as illustrated in the example below.

does not entail


#### 8.6.5. skos:related and Reflexivity

Note that this specification does not state that skos:related is a reflexive property, neither does it
state that skos:related is an irreflexive property.

Because skos:related is not defined as an
irreflexive property, the graph below is consistent with the
SKOS data model.

However, for many applications that use knowledge organization systems,
statements of the form X skos:related X are a potential problem.
Where this is the case, an application may wish to search for such statements
prior to processing SKOS data, although how an application should handle such
statements is not defined in this specification and may vary between
applications.


#### 8.6.6. skos:broader and Transitivity

Note that skos:broader is not a transitive
property. Similarly, skos:narrower is not a
transitive property. Therefore, the SKOS data model does not support an entailment as illustrated in the example below.

does not entail

However, skos:broader is a sub-property of skos:broaderTransitive , which is a transitive
property. Similarly, skos:narrower is a sub-property of skos:narrowerTransitive , which is a transitive
property. Therefore the SKOS data model does support the
entailments illustrated below.

entails

Note especially that, by convention, skos:broader and skos:narrower are only used to assert immediate
(i.e., direct) hierarchical links between two SKOS concepts. By convention, skos:broaderTransitive and skos:narrowerTransitive are not used to make assertions, but are instead used only
to draw inferences.

This pattern allows the information about direct (i.e., immediate)
hierarchical links to be preserved, which is necessary for many tasks (e.g.,
building various types of visual representation of a knowledge organization
system), whilst also providing a mechanism for conveniently querying the
transitive closure of those hierarchical links (which will include both
direct and indirect links), which is useful in other situations (e.g., query
expansion algorithms).

Note also that a sub-property of a transitive property is not necessarily transitive.

See also the note on alternative paths below.


#### 8.6.7. skos:broader and Reflexivity

Note that this specification makes no statements regarding the reflexive
characteristics of the skos:broader relationship. It does not
state that skos:broader is a reflexive
property, neither does it state that skos:broader is an irreflexive property. Thus for any graph and
resource <A> , the triple:

may or may not be present. This conservative position allows SKOS to be
used to model both KOS where the interpretation of skos:broader is reflexive (e.g., a direct translation of an inferred OWL sub-class
hierarchy), or KOS where skos:broader could be considered
irreflexive (as would be appropriate for most thesauri or classification
schemes).

Similarly, there are no assertions made as to the reflexivity or
irreflexivity of skos:narrower .

However, for many applications that use knowledge organization systems,
statements of the form X skos:broader X or Y skos:narrower Y represent a potential problem. Where this is the
case, an application may wish to search for such statements prior to
processing SKOS data, although how an application should handle such
statements is not defined in this specification and may vary between
applications.


#### 8.6.8. Cycles in the Hierarchical Relation
(skos:broaderTransitive and Reflexivity)

In the graph below, a cycle has been stated in the hierarchical relation.
Note that this graph is consistent with the SKOS data model,
i.e., there is no condition requiring that skos:broaderTransitive be irreflexive.

However, for many applications where knowledge organization systems are
used, a cycle in the hierarchical relation represents a potential problem.
For these applications, computing the transitive closure of skos:broaderTransitive then looking for statements of the form X skos:broaderTransitive X is a
convenient strategy for finding cycles in the hierarchical relation. How an
application should handle such statements is not defined in this
specification and may vary between applications.


#### 8.6.9. Alternate Paths in the Hierarchical Relation

In the graph below, there are two alternative paths from A to C in the
hierarchical relation.

In the graph below, there are two alternative paths from A to D in the
hierarchical relation.

This is a pattern which arises naturally in poly-hierarchical knowledge
organization systems.

Both of these graphs are consistent with the SKOS data
model, i.e., there is no condition requiring that there be
only one path between any two nodes in the hierarchical relation.


#### 8.6.10. Disjointness of skos:related and
skos:broaderTransitive

This specification treats the hierarchical and associative relations as
fundamentally distinct in nature. Therefore a clash between hierarchical
and associative links is not consistent with the SKOS data
model. The examples above illustrate some situations in which a clash is
seen to arise.

This position follows the usual definitions given to hierarchical and
associative relations in thesaurus standards [ ISO2788 ] [ BS8723-2 ], and supports common
practice in many existing knowledge organization systems.

Note that this specification takes the stronger position that, not only
are the immediate (i.e., direct) hierarchical and associative links disjoint,
but associative links are also disjoint with indirect hierarchical
links. This is captured formally in the integrity condition asserting that skos:related and skos:broaderTransitive are
disjoint properties.


## 9. Concept Collections


### 9.1. Preamble

SKOS concept collections are labeled and/or ordered groups of SKOS
concepts.

Collections are useful where a group of concepts shares something in
common, and it is convenient to group them under a common label, or where
some concepts can be placed in a meaningful order.


### 9.2. Vocabulary


### 9.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 9.4. Integrity Conditions


### 9.5. Examples

The graph below illustrates a SKOS collection with 3 members.

The graph below illustrates an ordered SKOS collection with 3 members.
Note the use of the Turtle syntax (...) , representing an RDF
Collection (list).


### 9.6. Notes


#### 9.6.1. Inferring Collections from Ordered Collections

Statement S36 states the logical relationship between the skos:memberList and skos:member properties. This
relationship means that a collection can be inferred from an ordered
collection. This is illustrated in the example below.

entails

Note that SKOS does not provide any way to explicitly state that a
collection is not ordered.


#### 9.6.2. skos:memberList Integrity

Note that skos:memberList is a functional property, i.e., it
does not have more than one value. This is intended to capture within the
SKOS data model that it doesn't make sense for an ordered collection to have
more than one member list. Unfortunately, there is no way to use this
condition as an integrity condition without explicitly stating that two lists
are different objects. In other words, although the graph below is consistent with the SKOS data model, it entails nonsense (a
list with two first elements and a forked tail).

entails

However, as stated in [ RDF-SEMANTICS ] section 3.3.3, semantic
extensions to RDF may place extra syntactic well-formedness
restrictions on the use of the RDF collection vocabulary
( rdf:first , rdf:rest , rdf:nil )
in order to rule out such graphs.


#### 9.6.3. Nested Collections

In the example below, a collection is nested within another collection.

This example is consistent with the SKOS data
model, because the range of skos:member is the
union of skos:Concept and skos:Collection .


#### 9.6.4. SKOS Concepts, Concept Collections and Semantic
Relations

In the SKOS data model, skos:Concept and skos:Collection are disjoint classes. The domain and range of
the SKOS semantic relation properties is skos:Concept .
Therefore, if any of the SKOS semantic relation properties (e.g., skos:narrower ) are used to link to or from a collection, the
graph will not be consistent with the SKOS data model.

This is illustrated in the example below, which is not consistent with the SKOS data model.

Similarly, the graph below is not consistent with the
SKOS data model.

Similarly, the graph below is not consistent with the
SKOS data model.

However, the graph below is consistent with the SKOS data model.

This means that, for thesauri and other knowledge organization systems
where node labels are used within the systematic display for that
thesaurus, the appropriate SKOS representation requires careful
consideration. Furthermore, where node labels are used in the systematic
display, it may not always be possible to fully reconstruct the systematic
display from a SKOS representation alone. Fully representing all of the
information represented in a systematic display of a thesaurus or other
knowledge organization system, including details of layout and presentation,
is beyond the scope of SKOS.


## 10. Mapping Properties


### 10.1. Preamble

The SKOS mapping properties are skos:closeMatch , skos:exactMatch , skos:broadMatch , skos:narrowMatch and skos:relatedMatch . These
properties are used to state mapping (alignment) links between SKOS concepts
in different concept schemes, where the links are inherent in the meaning of
the linked concepts.

The properties skos:broadMatch and skos:narrowMatch are used to state a hierarchical mapping link
between two concepts.

The property skos:relatedMatch is used to state an
associative mapping link between two concepts.

The property skos:closeMatch is used to link two concepts
that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid
the possibility of "compound errors" when combining mappings across more than
two concept schemes, skos:closeMatch is not declared to be a transitive property.

The property skos:exactMatch is used to link two concepts,
indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used
interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications. skos:exactMatch is a transitive property, and is a sub-property
of skos:closeMatch .


### 10.2. Vocabulary


### 10.3. Class & Property Definitions


### 10.4. Integrity Conditions

Note that because skos:exactMatch is a symmetric property, and skos:broadMatch and skos:narrowMatch are inverses, skos:exactMatch is therefore also disjoint with skos:narrowMatch .


### 10.5. Examples

The graph below asserts an exact equivalence mapping link between <A> and <B> .

The graph below asserts a close equivalence mapping link between <A> and <B> .

The graph below asserts a hierarchical mapping link between <A> and <B> (where <B> is broader than <A> ), and an
associative mapping link between <A> and <C> .

The graph below is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between exact and hierarchical mapping
links.

The graph below is not consistent with the SKOS data
model, because there is a clash between exact and associative mapping
links.


### 10.6. Notes


#### 10.6.1. Mapping Properties, Semantic Relation Properties and
Concept Schemes

By convention, the SKOS mapping properties are only used to link concepts
in different concept schemes. However, note that using the
SKOS semantic relation properties ( skos:broader , skos:narrower , skos:related ) to link concepts in different concept schemes is also consistent with the SKOS data model (see Section 8 ).

The mapping properties skos:broadMatch , skos:narrowMatch and skos:relatedMatch are provided
as a convenience, for situations where the provenance of data is known, and
it is useful to be able to tell at a glance the difference between internal
links within a concept scheme and mapping links between concept schemes.

However, using the SKOS mapping properties is no
substitute for the careful management of RDF graphs or the use of
provenance mechanisms.

The rationale behind this design is that it is hard to draw an absolute
distinction between internal links within a concept scheme and mapping links
between concept schemes. This is especially true in an open environment where
different people might re-organize concepts into concept schemes in different
ways. What one person views as two concept schemes with mapping links
between, another might view as one single concept scheme with internal links
only. This specification allows both points of view to co-exist, which (it is
hoped) will promote flexibility and innovation in the re-use of SKOS data in
the Web.

There is therefore an intimate connection between the SKOS semantic
relation properties and the SKOS mapping properties. The property skos:broadMatch is a sub-property of skos:broader , skos:narrowMatch is a sub-property of skos:narrower , and skos:relatedMatch is a
sub-property of skos:related . The full set of sub-property
relationships is illustrated below.

skos:semanticRelation

 +- skos:related
 |   |
 |   +- skos:relatedMatch
 |
 +- skos:broaderTransitive

     +- skos:relatedMatch
     |
     +- skos:broadMatch
     |
     +- skos:narrowMatch

Examples below illustrate some entailments which follow from this
sub-property tree, and from the domain and range of skos:semanticRelation .

entails

entails

Note also that, because different people might re-organize concepts into
concept schemes in different ways, a graph might assert mapping links between concepts in the same concept scheme, and there are no formal integrity conditions
in the SKOS data model that would make such a graph inconsistent, e.g., the
graph below is consistent with the SKOS data model. However,
in practice it is expected that such a graph would only ever arise from the
merge of two or more graphs from different sources.


#### 10.6.2. Clashes Between Hierarchical and Associative
Links

Examples below illustrate "clashes" between hierarchical and associative
mapping links, which are not consistent with the SKOS data
model (because of the sub-property relationships illustrated above, and
because of the data model for SKOS semantic relation properties defined in Section 8 ).


#### 10.6.3. Mapping Properties and Transitivity

The only SKOS mapping property which is declared as transitive is skos:exactMatch . An example entailment is illustrated below:

entails

All other SKOS mapping properties are not transitive. Therefore,
entailments as illustrated in examples below are not supported by the SKOS data model.

does not entail

does not entail

does not entail


#### 10.6.4. Mapping Properties and Reflexivity

None of the SKOS mapping properties are
reflexive, neither are they irreflexive.

Because skos:exactMatch , skos:broadMatch and skos:relatedMatch are not irreflexive , the graph below is consistent with the SKOS data model.

However, see also Section 8 on the
reflexivity of SKOS semantic relation properties.


#### 10.6.5. Cycles and Alternate Paths Involving
skos:broadMatch

There are no formal integrity conditions preventing either cycles or
alternative paths in a graph of hierarchical mapping links.

In the graph below there are two cycles involving skos:broadMatch . This graph is consistent with
the SKOS data model.

In the graph below there are two alternative paths involving skos:broadMatch . This graph is consistent with
the SKOS data model.

See however Section 8 on cycles and
alternative paths involving skos:broader .


#### 10.6.6. Cycles Involving skos:exactMatch and skos:closeMatch

entails

Due to the entailment above (which arises through a combination
of S42 , S44 and S45 ), applications must be able to cope with
cycles in skos:exactMatch and skos:closeMatch .


#### 10.6.7. Sub-Property Chains Involving skos:exactMatch

There are no sub-property chain axioms in the SKOS data model involving the skos:exactMatch or skos:closeMatch properties.
Hence the entailments illustrated below are not supported.

does not entail

does not entail

does not entail

does not entail


#### 10.6.8. skos:closeMatch, skos:exactMatch, owl:sameAs,
owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty

OWL provides three properties which might, at first glance, appear similar
to skos:closeMatch or skos:exactMatch . owl:sameAs is used to link two individuals in an ontology, and
indicates that they are the same individual (i.e., the same resource). owl:equivalentClass is used to link two classes in an ontology,
and indicates that those classes have the same class extension. owl:equivalentProperty is used to link two properties in an
ontology and indicates that both properties have the same property
extension.

skos:closeMatch and skos:exactMatch are used to
link SKOS concepts in different schemes. A skos:closeMatch link
indicates that two concepts are sufficiently similar that they can be used
interchangeably in some information retrieval applications.
A skos:exactMatch link indicates a high degree of confidence
that two concepts can be used interchangeably across a wide range of
information retrieval applications.

owl:sameAs , owl:equivalentClass or owl:equivalentProperty would typically be inappropriate for
linking SKOS concepts in different concept schemes, because the formal
consequences that follow could be undesirable.

The example below illustrates some undesirable entailments that would
follow from using owl:sameAs in this way.

entails

In this example, using owl:sameAs to link two SKOS concepts
in different concept schemes does actually lead to an inconsistency with the
SKOS data model, because both <A> and <B> now have two preferred lexical labels in the same
language. This will not always be the case, however.

## Appendix B. SKOS eXtension for Labels (SKOS-XL)

This appendix defines an optional extension to the Simple
Knowledge Organization System, called the SKOS eXtension for Labels (SKOS-XL).
This extension provides additional support for identifying, describing and
linking lexical entities.

A special class of lexical entities, called skosxl:Label , is
defined. Each instance of this class has a single RDF plain literal form, but
two instances of this class are not necessarily the same individual if they
share the same literal form.

Three labeling properties, skosxl:prefLabel , skosxl:altLabel and skosxl:hiddenLabel , are
defined. These properties are used to label SKOS concepts with instances of skosxl:Label , and are otherwise analogous to the properties of
the same local name defined in SKOS ( skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel respectively).

The SKOS data model also defines the property skosxl:labelRelation . This property can be used to assert a
direct (binary) link between instances of skosxl:Label . It is
primarily intended as an extension point, to be refined for more specific
types of link. No built-in refinements of skosxl:labelRelation are provided, although some examples of how this could be done are given.


### B.1. SKOS-XL Namespace and Vocabulary

The SKOS-XL namespace URI is:

http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#

Here the prefix skosxl: is used as an abbreviation for the SKOS-XL
namespace URI.

The SKOS-XL vocabulary is the set of URIs given in the left-hand column of the
table below.

Here "the SKOS-XL vocabulary" refers to the union of the SKOS vocabulary
and the SKOS-XL vocabulary.

Here "the XL data model" refers to the class and property definitions
stated in this appendix only. "The SKOS+XL data model" refers to the union of
the data model defined in sections 3-10 above and the XL data model.


### B.2. The skosxl:Label Class


#### B.2.1. Preamble

The class skosxl:Label is a special class of lexical
entities.

An instance of the class skosxl:Label is a resource and may
be named with a URI.

An instance of the class skosxl:Label has a single literal
form. This literal form is an RDF plain literal (which is a string of UNICODE
characters and an optional language tag [ RDF-CONCEPTS ]). The property skosxl:literalForm is used to give the literal form of an skosxl:Label .

If two instances of the class skosxl:Label have the same
literal form, they are not necessarily the same resource.


#### B.2.2. Class and Property Definitions


#### B.2.3. Examples

The example below describes a skosxl:Label named with the
URI <http://example.com/ns/A> , with the literal form
"love" in English.

The four examples below are each not consistent with the
XL data model, because an skosxl:Label is described with two
different literal forms.


#### B.2.4. Notes

As stated above, each instance of the class skosxl:Label has one and only one literal form . In other words, there is a
function mapping the class extension of skosxl:Label to the set
of RDF plain literals. This function is defined by the property extension of skosxl:literalForm . Note especially two facts about this
function.

First, the function is not injective. In other words,
there is not a one-to-one mapping from instances of skosxl:Label to the set of RDF plain literals (in fact it is
many-to-one). This means that two instances of skosxl:Label which have the same literal form are not necessarily the
same individual. So, for example, the entailment illustrated below is not supported by the XL data model.

does not entail

Second, the function is not surjective. In other words,
for a given plain literal l , there might not be any instances of skosxl:Label with literal form l .

The membership of an instance of skosxl:Label within a SKOS
concept scheme can be asserted using the skos:inScheme property.


### B.3. Preferred, Alternate and Hidden skosxl:Labels


#### B.3.1. Preamble

The three properties skosxl:prefLabel , skosxl:altLabel and skosxl:hiddenLabel are used to
give the preferred, alternative and hidden labels of a resource respectively,
where those labels are instances of the class skosxl:Label .
These properties are analogous to the properties of the same local name
defined in the SKOS vocabulary, and there are logical dependencies between
these two sets of properties defined below.


#### B.3.2. Class and Property Definitions


#### B.3.3. Examples

The example below illustrates the use of all three XL labeling properties,
and is consistent with the SKOS+XL data model.


#### B.3.4. Notes

The sub-property chain axioms S55 , S56 and S57 support the dumbing-down of XL labels
to vanilla SKOS lexical labels via inference. This is illustrated in the
example below.

entails

In Section 5 , two integrity conditions were defined
on the basic SKOS labeling properties. First, the properties skos:prefLabel , skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel are pairwise disjoint. Second, a resource has
no more than one value of skos:prefLabel per language. Because
of the sub-property chain axioms defined above, the following four examples,
whilst consistent w.r.t. the XL data model alone, are not consistent with the SKOS+XL data model.


### B.4. Links Between skosxl:Labels


#### B.4.1. Preamble

This section defines a pattern for representing binary links between
instances of the class skosxl:Label .

Note that the vocabulary defined in this section is not intended to be
used directly, but rather as an extension point which can be refined for more
specific labeling scenarios.


#### B.4.2. Class and Property Definitions


#### B.4.3. Examples

The example below illustrates a link between two instances of the class skosxl:Label .


#### B.4.4. Notes

As mentioned above, the skosxl:labelRelation property serves
as an extension point, which can be refined for more specific labeling
scenarios.

In the example below, a third party has refined the property skos:labelRelation to express acronym relationships, and used it
to express the fact that "FAO" is an acronym for "Food and Agriculture
Organization".

Note that a sub-property of a symmetric property is not necessarily
symmetric.

## Appendix C. SKOS and SKOS-XL Namespace Documents

Following Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One [ WEBARCH ], a
"namespace document" is an "information resource that contains useful
information, machine-usable and/or human-usable, about terms in the
namespace".

The SKOS vocabulary is a conceptual resource identified by the
namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# .  The
normative definition of the SKOS vocabulary is found in SKOS Reference
(this document).

The following namespace documents provide alternative
representations of the SKOS vocabulary:


### C.1. SKOS Namespace Document - HTML Variant (normative)

The SKOS vocabulary is summarized in SKOS Namespace Document - HTML
Variant [ SKOS-HTML ], which is served from the
namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# via content negotiation using Recipe 3 of "Best Practice Recipes for
Publishing Vocabularies" [ RECIPES ]. Clients requiring HTML or XHTML
should include an appropriate "Accept" header in the HTTP
request. Alternatively, the SKOS Namespace Document - HTML Variant can
be referenced directly by citing its URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos.html .

The
SKOS Namespace Document - HTML Variant replicates Appendix
A. SKOS Properties and Classes of this document.


### C.2. SKOS Namespace Document - RDF/XML Variant (normative)

The SKOS Namespace Document - RDF/XML Variant [ SKOS-RDF ] expresses the SKOS
vocabulary and data model (in so far as possible) as RDF triples.  It
is served via content negotiation using Recipe 3 of "Best Practice
Recipes for Publishing Vocabularies" [ RECIPES ].  Clients requiring
RDF/XML should include an appropriate "Accept" header in the HTTP
request.  Alternatively, the RDF schema can be referenced directly
(and downloaded) by citing its URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos.rdf .

It is not possible to express all of the statements of the SKOS
data model as RDF triples, so this schema forms a normative subset of
SKOS Reference.  The RDF schema defines an OWL Full ontology
[ OWL-SEMANTICS ] [ OWL-REFERENCE ].  SKOS vocabularies can be defined as
instances of this ontology.


### C.3. SKOS RDF Schema - OWL 1 DL Sub-set (informative)

For the convenience of tools and applications that wish to work
within the constraints of OWL DL, the SKOS RDF Schema - OWL 1 DL
Sub-set [ SKOS-RDF-OWL1-DL ] provides a
modified, informative, schema which conforms to those constraints.
Note that this schema is obtained through the deletion of triples
representing axioms that violate OWL DL constraints.  Alternative
prunings could be performed.

The SKOS OWL 1 DL Sub-set is available
by citing its URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-owl1-dl.rdf


### C.4. SKOS-XL Namespace Document - HTML Variant (normative)

The SKOS-XL vocabulary is summarized in SKOS-XL Namespace Document
- HTML Variant [ SKOS-XL-HTML ], which is served from the
namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl# via content negotiation using Recipe 3 of "Best Practice Recipes for
Publishing Vocabularies" [ RECIPES ].  Clients requiring HTML or XHTML
should include an appropriate "Accept" header in the HTTP
request. Alternatively, the SKOS-XL Namespace Document - HTML Variant
can be referenced directly by citing its URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.html .

The SKOS-XL HTML Variant Namespace Document replicates Appendix
B.5 SKOS-XL Schema Overview of this document.


### C.5. SKOS-XL Namespace Document - RDF/XML Variant (normative)

This RDF schema document expresses the SKOS vocabulary and data
model (in so far as possible) as RDF triples.  It is served 
from the namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl# via content
negotiation using Recipe 3 of "Best Practice Recipes for Publishing
Vocabularies" [ RECIPES ].  Clients requiring RDF/XML should
include an appropriate "Accept" header in the HTTP request.
Alternatively, the RDF schema can be referenced directly (and
downloaded) by citing its URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.rdf .


## Appendix D. SKOS Namespace: a historical note

The SKOS schema defines vocabulary using the namespace http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# .
  This namespace was used to define the original SKOS schema which
  served as a starting point for this Recommendation. As a result of
  this, elements present in previous versions of the machine-readable schema have been removed from the current version. In a number of cases, the definition or semantics of
  elements in the schema has changed.

Retaining the existing SKOS namespace avoids some issues with
  existing KOS that are already using the SKOS schema. Users
  should, however, be aware of the change in the semantics of skos:broader (and skos:narrower ) which may impact on SKOS applications.

Where elements have been removed, no explicit deprecation axioms
  have been expressed in the schema. Historical versions of the SKOS schema, are,
  however, available from the SKOS Web site "version history" page , and those elements which have been removed
  from the recent version of the vocabulary are listed below.

skos:symbol

skos:prefSymbol

skos:altSymbol

skos:CollectableProperty

skos:subject

skos:isSubjectOf

skos:primarySubject

skos:isPrimarySubjectOf

skos:subjectIndicator

In the case of skos:broader and skos:narrower , the semantics of the vocabulary elements
  have been changed — these properties are no longer declared to be
  transitive. Thus the follow entailment does not hold.

does not entail

A transitive super property of skos:broader — skos:broaderTransitive — is provided which allows for
  query across the transitive closure of skos:broader relations. A similar property
  — skos:narrowerTransitive — is provided
  for query across the transitive closure of skos:narrower .
