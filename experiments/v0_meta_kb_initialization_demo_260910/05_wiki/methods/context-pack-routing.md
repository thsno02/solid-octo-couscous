# Context-pack routing

## Purpose

Bounded retrieval through maps, lexical search, graph expansion, and evidence expansion.

## Candidate evidence

- **AgentRxiv: Towards Collaborative Autonomous Research** (source assertion): Progress in scientific discovery is rarely the result of a single "Eureka" moment, but is rather the product of hundreds of scientists incrementally working together toward a common goal. While existing agent workflows are capable of producing research autonomously, they do so in isolation, without the ability to continuously improve upon prior research results. 〔[claim:07439fdff0cc0aa3](../claims/claim-07439fdff0cc0aa3.md)〕
- **Gradient Episodic Memory for Continual Learning** (source assertion): One major obstacle towards AI is the poor ability of models to solve new problems quicker, and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. To better understand this issue, we study the problem of continual learning, where the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning a sequence of tasks. 〔[claim:12237a4df4847d59](../claims/claim-12237a4df4847d59.md)〕
- **LeanDojo: Theorem Proving with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models** (source assertion): Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants such as Lean. However, existing methods are difficult to reproduce or build on, due to private code, data, and large compute requirements. 〔[claim:a67432ee7afb1535](../claims/claim-a67432ee7afb1535.md)〕
- **getzep/graphiti** (source assertion): ⭐ *Help us reach more developers and grow the Graphiti community. 〔[claim:bc85c4d0c6801c3a](../claims/claim-bc85c4d0c6801c3a.md)〕
- **Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory** (source assertion): We introduce Zep, a novel memory layer service for AI agents that outperforms the current state-of-the-art system, MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. 〔[claim:ef04f2ebbd2da425](../claims/claim-ef04f2ebbd2da425.md)〕
- **Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large Language Models** (source assertion): We study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. 〔[claim:1929edca74fa3fa5](../claims/claim-1929edca74fa3fa5.md)〕
- **FActScore: Fine-grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation** (source assertion): Evaluating the factuality of long-form text generated by large language models (LMs) is non-trivial because (1) generations often contain a mixture of supported and unsupported pieces of information, making binary judgments of quality inadequate, and (2) human evaluation is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we introduce , a new evaluation that breaks a generation into a series of atomic facts and computes the 〔[claim:b281f7d7bc21b10d](../claims/claim-b281f7d7bc21b10d.md)〕
- **Detecting Corpus-Level Knowledge Inconsistencies in Wikipedia with Large Language Models** (source assertion): Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is therefore critical. 〔[claim:bc9a34bd8a9c7154](../claims/claim-bc9a34bd8a9c7154.md)〕
- **Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations** (source assertion): Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a widely-used tool for information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations , improving their factual correctness and verifiability. 〔[claim:bed2f056ecd73c69](../claims/claim-bed2f056ecd73c69.md)〕
- **VectifyAI/OpenKB** (source assertion): **OpenKB (Open Knowledge Base)** is an open-source system (in CLI) that compiles raw documents into a structured, interlinked wiki-style knowledge base using LLMs, powered by [**PageIndex**](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex)'s vectorless, reasoning-based retrieval for long documents. 〔[claim:e7026275c099e7e2](../claims/claim-e7026275c099e7e2.md)〕
- **xoai/sage-wiki** (source assertion): **sage-wiki** is a graph memory and knowledge base that AI agents and humans build and query together. Drop in documents; an LLM compiler turns them into an interlinked wiki with a knowledge graph — agents query it through MCP, humans browse it as plain markdown. 〔[claim:e7ac7da9ac39e47d](../claims/claim-e7ac7da9ac39e47d.md)〕
- **Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery** (source assertion): Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. 〔[claim:0edb741be0f31f6f](../claims/claim-0edb741be0f31f6f.md)〕

## Compiled interpretation

This page reorganizes candidate knowledge around a stable reader task. It is not source concatenation and it does not turn retrieval, maintainer claims, preprints, or generated prose into verified truth.

## Review boundary

Check evidence entailment, source independence, contradiction, neutrality, due weight, freshness, and downstream impact before publication.

## Routing

```text
query + freshness need
→ maps and lexical index
→ graph expansion
→ rerank by support, freshness, authority, task fit
→ bounded context pack
→ claim/source expansion when needed
```
