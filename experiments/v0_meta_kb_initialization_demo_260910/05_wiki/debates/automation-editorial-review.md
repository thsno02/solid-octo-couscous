# Automation versus editorial review

## Purpose

Automation accelerates research and writing but requires independent evidence and governance gates.

## Candidate evidence

- **Agent Laboratory: Using LLM Agents as Research Assistants** (source assertion): Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. 〔[claim:2f8ebd974fc7b5fd](../claims/claim-2f8ebd974fc7b5fd.md)〕
- **The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery** (source assertion): One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. 〔[claim:38c95b3e2bcfcf51](../claims/claim-38c95b3e2bcfcf51.md)〕
- **Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery** (source assertion): Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow. 〔[claim:3c6cef89711e89f2](../claims/claim-3c6cef89711e89f2.md)〕
- **The AI Scientist-v2: Workshop-Level Automated Scientific Discovery via Agentic Tree Search** (source assertion): AI is increasingly playing a pivotal role in transforming how scientific discoveries are made. We introduce , an end-to-end agentic system capable of producing the first entirely AI-generated peer-review-accepted workshop paper. 〔[claim:9077f46d7f30e565](../claims/claim-9077f46d7f30e565.md)〕
- **MLGym: A New Framework and Benchmark for Advancing AI Research Agents** (source assertion): We introduce Meta and -Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. 〔[claim:4bf5ea8e6b4e37de](../claims/claim-4bf5ea8e6b4e37de.md)〕
- **DISCOVERYWORLD: A Virtual Environment for Developing and Evaluating Automated Scientific Discovery Agents** (source assertion): Automated scientific discovery promises to accelerate progress across scientific domains. However, developing and evaluating an AI agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. 〔[claim:84c91602bd1dfb78](../claims/claim-84c91602bd1dfb78.md)〕
- **AIRS-Bench: a Suite of Tasks for Frontier AI Research Science Agents** (source assertion): LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce ~(the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. 〔[claim:ecdd2719fa55751c](../claims/claim-ecdd2719fa55751c.md)〕
- **Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large Language Models** (source assertion): We study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. 〔[claim:1929edca74fa3fa5](../claims/claim-1929edca74fa3fa5.md)〕
- **FActScore: Fine-grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation** (source assertion): Evaluating the factuality of long-form text generated by large language models (LMs) is non-trivial because (1) generations often contain a mixture of supported and unsupported pieces of information, making binary judgments of quality inadequate, and (2) human evaluation is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we introduce , a new evaluation that breaks a generation into a series of atomic facts and computes the 〔[claim:b281f7d7bc21b10d](../claims/claim-b281f7d7bc21b10d.md)〕
- **Detecting Corpus-Level Knowledge Inconsistencies in Wikipedia with Large Language Models** (source assertion): Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is therefore critical. 〔[claim:bc9a34bd8a9c7154](../claims/claim-bc9a34bd8a9c7154.md)〕
- **Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations** (source assertion): Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a widely-used tool for information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations , improving their factual correctness and verifiability. 〔[claim:bed2f056ecd73c69](../claims/claim-bed2f056ecd73c69.md)〕
- **VectifyAI/OpenKB** (source assertion): **OpenKB (Open Knowledge Base)** is an open-source system (in CLI) that compiles raw documents into a structured, interlinked wiki-style knowledge base using LLMs, powered by [**PageIndex**](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex)'s vectorless, reasoning-based retrieval for long documents. 〔[claim:e7026275c099e7e2](../claims/claim-e7026275c099e7e2.md)〕

## Compiled interpretation

This page reorganizes candidate knowledge around a stable reader task. It is not source concatenation and it does not turn retrieval, maintainer claims, preprints, or generated prose into verified truth.

## Review boundary

Check evidence entailment, source independence, contradiction, neutrality, due weight, freshness, and downstream impact before publication.

## Preserved disagreement

Automation is useful for perspective discovery, extraction, planning, drafting, and linting. Independent review remains necessary for identity merges, contested claims, source retractions, policy-sensitive content, and trust promotion.
